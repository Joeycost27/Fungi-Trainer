1	YES	Armillaria mellea	Honey Fungus	Extensive white mycelial fans visible under bark at root collar when bark peeled, firm texture, spreading pattern	Black rhizomorphs (bootlaces) visible in soil radiating from base, 2-4mm diameter, tough and string-like	No visible external symptoms on bark surface	No visible external symptoms	No visible symptoms on branches	Progressive crown thinning starting in upper crown, 45% density, leaves smaller than normal, premature autumn colour	The combination of white mycelial fans under bark PLUS black rhizomorphs in soil is DIAGNOSTIC for Armillaria. No other fungus produces bootlace-like rhizomorphs. Crown thinning without lower stem symptoms indicates root/vascular compromise from below. Often no fruiting bodies visible when symptoms appear.	GANODERMA: Has woody brackets at base, NO rhizomorphs, brown spore deposits. PSEUDOINONOTUS DRYADEUS: Amber droplets on brackets, NO rhizomorphs. MERIPILUS: Large rosette fruiting bodies with brown bruising, NO rhizomorphs. UNIQUE TO ARMILLARIA: Rhizomorphs are unique (only this genus), white mycelial fans under bark, mushroomy smell when bark peeled, often no visible fruiting when tree symptomatic.	Smell: Strong mushroomy odour under bark when peeled. Progression: Can kill trees in 2-5 years or persist for decades depending on host vigour. Host range: Very wide (most broadleaves and conifers susceptible). Spread: Root-to-root contact underground. Risk level: HIGH - aggressive pathogen, can spread through tree populations.	If you see rhizomorphs or bootlaces in exam question = ALWAYS Armillaria (no other fungus has these). If mycelial fans under bark at collar = likely Armillaria, definitive if rhizomorphs also present. Remember double-L in Armillaria and double-L in mellea.	armillaria_fans_rhizomorphs
2	YES	Ganoderma australe	Southern Bracket	Root flare shows soft fibrous white rot when probed, spongy texture, structural roots affected in excavation	Large hoof-shaped perennial brackets present, concentrically zoned brown upper surface, white margin when actively growing, hard and woody texture	White pore surface on underside of brackets, brown spore deposits visible on ground or lower bark below brackets	No visible symptoms	No visible symptoms	Crown density 70-80%, appears relatively healthy despite root decay	Brown spore deposits on ground beneath brackets are diagnostic for Ganoderma genus. Hoof-shaped woody brackets with zoned brown surface distinguish G. australe. Root decay causes windthrow risk while crown appears deceptively healthy (roots fail before vascular function compromised). White fibrous rot in roots typical.	GANODERMA APPLANATUM: Flat shelf-like brackets (not hoof-shaped), thinner, grey-brown colour. GANODERMA RESINACEUM: Resinous coating on bracket surface. MERIPILUS: Rosette form at base, brown bruising diagnostic. PSEUDOINONOTUS DRYADEUS: Amber droplets, rough bracket surface. UNIQUE TO G. AUSTRALE: Hoof-shaped form, zoned brown surface, hard woody texture, heavy spore deposits, white pore surface.	Location: Root collar and root flare, rarely higher on stem. Decay type: White rot of roots (soft, fibrous, stringy). Failure mode: Windthrow most common (roots fail). Crown condition: Often healthy appearance until failure (misleading). Spores: Prolific brown spore production creates deposits. Growth: Perennial brackets add new layer each year.	HOOF-SHAPED bracket = G. australe. If FLAT shelf = G. applanatum. Heavy brown spore deposits = Ganoderma genus (multiple species possible). Remember: Ganoderma has two N's, australe has no double letters. Australe means southern - remember Australia connection.	ganoderma_australe_hoof
3	YES	Ganoderma applanatum	Artist's Bracket	Root plate excavation shows white rot in structural roots, stringy fibrous texture	Large flat shelf-like brackets at base, grey-brown upper surface (not zoned), overlapping tiers possible, very hard woody texture	Brackets can extend up lower stem, flat shelf form continues, brown spore deposits accumulate on lower bark	No visible symptoms	No visible symptoms	Crown 75% density, foliage appears healthy despite root compromise	Flat shelf-like brackets distinguish G. applanatum from hoof-shaped G. australe. Grey-brown (not concentrically zoned brown) upper surface diagnostic. White pore surface browns when scratched (artist's bracket name origin). Massive brown spore production creates heavy deposits. Root rot while crown healthy = typical Ganoderma pattern.	GANODERMA AUSTRALE: Hoof-shaped (not flat), zoned brown surface. GANODERMA RESINACEUM: Resinous coating. FOMES FOMENTARIUS: Grey hoof-shaped, on beech, higher on stem. CERIOPORUS SQUAMOSUS: Scaly cap, cream pores, distinct stalk. UNIQUE TO G. APPLANATUM: Flat shelf form, grey-brown colour (not zoned), white pore surface browns when scratched, can draw on pore surface (artist's use).	Location: Base and lower stem, can extend higher than G. australe. Size: Very large brackets possible (30-50cm diameter). Spores: Prolific spore production, brown deposits diagnostic. Pore surface: White, browns permanently when scratched (artwork surface). Multiple tiers: Often overlapping shelf brackets. Growth: Perennial, new pore layer each year.	FLAT shelf = G. applanatum. HOOF-shaped = G. australe. Scratch test: If white pore surface browns when scratched = G. applanatum (diagnostic test). Remember spelling: applanatum has double-P, double-N.	ganoderma_applanatum_shelf

Root collar location specific. Rust-brown pore surface distinctive. Causes severe root decay while crown remains deceptively healthy. Oak specialist (occasionally other broadleaves).	GANODERMA: Hoof or shelf form, NO amber droplets, white pores, brown spores. MERIPILUS: Rosette form, brown bruising, NO droplets. CERIOPORUS SQUAMOSUS: Scaly cap, cream pores, stalk present, NO droplets. UNIQUE TO PSEUDOINONOTUS DRYADEUS: Amber droplets (unique weeping), root collar location, rough irregular bracket, rust-brown pores, oak association.	Host: Primarily oak (Quercus), occasionally sweet chestnut. Location: Root collar specifically (not higher stem). Droplets: Amber liquid exudate on young brackets (may dry in older brackets). Decay: White rot of roots, severe anchorage loss. Failure: Windthrow risk high. Progression: Slow, tree may survive years with extensive decay.	AMBER DROPLETS on brackets at OAK ROOT COLLAR = Pseudoinonotus dryadeus. Droplets are unique - no other common fungus has them. Current accepted name is Pseudoinonotus dryadeus - use this in exam answers. Dryadeus refers to dryads (oak tree spirits). Amber weeping = only one answer.	pseudoinonotus_dryadeus_retired

Brown/black bruising when bracket touched (fresh brackets) - unique identifier. Very large overall size (can exceed 1m diameter rosette). Annual fruiting (not perennial like Ganoderma). Causes severe root decay and windthrow risk.	GANODERMA: Hoof or shelf form (not rosette), hard woody texture, perennial, NO bruising. PSEUDOINONOTUS DRYADEUS: Smaller brackets, amber droplets, NO bruising. CERIOPORUS SQUAMOSUS: Individual stalked brackets, scaly cap, NO bruising, cream pores. UNIQUE TO MERIPILUS: Rosette form, brown/black bruising when touched (diagnostic), very large size, annual brackets (soft texture), cream-brown pore surface.	Fruiting: Annual (appears late summer/autumn, degrades over winter). Size: Very large rosettes, impressive when fully developed. Bruising: Fresh brackets bruise brown/black when handled (diagnostic test). Decay: White rot of roots and root collar. Failure mode: Windthrow. Smell: No strong odour. Previous fruiting: Check for old degraded brackets from previous years (fibrous remains).	If description says bruises brown/black when touched = ALWAYS Meripilus (unique feature among common fungi). Giganteus = giant size. Rosette form diagnostic. Remember: Meripilus has one-R, giganteus has one-G. Bruising test = quick ID in field.	meripilus_rosette_bruising
6	YES	Kretzschmaria deusta	Brittle Cinder	No visible root symptoms typically	Grey powdery patches on bark at base progressing to hard black crusty stromata - bark loose and peeling away, tissue beneath dark and brittle when snapped	Black crusty stromata extending up lower stem, can cover 180-270° of circumference, bark falls away exposing black brittle tissue beneath	Extension of stromata may reach 2-3m height in advanced cases	No visible symptoms	Crown thinning and dieback in advanced stages, leaves smaller, premature yellowing - healthy crown appearance masks severity until late	Grey-to-black crusty stromata on the STEM (not brackets, not rhizomorphs) combined with BRITTLE ceramic-like fracture of the wood beneath is unique to Kretzschmaria. The most dangerous common decay fungus - causes sudden catastrophic failure with minimal warning. Crown remains deceptively healthy until very late stage. Acts on the stem, not the roots.	ARMILLARIA: White fans and rhizomorphs, root-based, not brittle fracture. GANODERMA: Brackets at base, root decay, NOT brittle. BJERKANDERA: Small thin brackets on dead wood only, saprophytic, NOT brittle. UNIQUE TO KRETZSCHMARIA: Grey-to-black stromata (no bracket, no rhizomorphs), BRITTLE ceramic-like fracture (unique decay type - wood snaps cleanly like fired clay), stem-based not root-based, sudden failure mode, most dangerous common fungus.	Progression: Grey powdery stage -> hard black crusty stromata. Decay type: Soft rot causing BRITTLE fracture - wood snaps cleanly with no fibrous tearing (unique). Failure mode: Sudden catastrophic snap with no warning. Location: Lower stem primarily, not roots. Danger level: HIGHEST of all common fungi - emergency removal usually indicated. Crown: Remains healthy-looking until very late (misleading). Speed: Relatively fast once established.	GREY-TO-BLACK CRUST on STEM (not brackets, not bootlaces) = Kretzschmaria deusta. BRITTLE fracture of wood beneath = confirmed. Most dangerous common fungus - highest priority for removal. Remember: Kretzschmaria (K-r-e-t-z, unusual spelling), deusta = burnt (black appearance). Grey stage AND black stage are the same fungus at different points.	kretzschmaria_black_stromata

Spread: Root-to-root contact AND airborne spores colonising fresh cut stumps - stump treatment mandatory after felling in infected stands. Decay: White rot of butt and roots. Risk: Catastrophic in plantations - can render entire stands unstable. Detection: Often no external symptoms until advanced decay.	WHITE irregular bracket/crust at CONIFER BASE = Heterobasidion annosum until proven otherwise. No rhizomorphs separates it from Armillaria. CONIFER host is the first filter - if broadleaf, look elsewhere. Remember: Heterobasidion (Het-er-o-bas-id-i-on - seven syllables), annosum (double-N: a-nn-o-sum). Stump treatment knowledge may appear in exam context.	heterobasidion_white_crust
20	YES	Phaeolus schweinitzii	Dyer's Mazegill	Root plate shows brown cubical rot when probed - wood fractures in cube-like blocks, structural roots compromised	Large annual bracket at base, velvety surface, yellow-green to rust-brown colouring with distinctive YELLOW-GREEN actively growing outer margin, spongy and soft when fresh	Bracket can extend onto lower stem, same yellow-green margin visible, degrades rapidly - fibrous remains from previous years may be visible	No visible symptoms	No visible symptoms	Crown shows progressive thinning, needle drop in conifers, deadwood in lower crown sections - tree declining from root compromise	The YELLOW-GREEN growing margin on a large spongy annual bracket at the base of CONIFERS is unique - no other common fungus has this combination. Soft and spongy when fresh (can be pressed with finger). Causes brown cubical rot (wood fractures in cubes - not stringy like white rot). Degrades to fibrous brown remains over winter - old bracket remains are a supporting clue.	MERIPILUS: Rosette of overlapping brackets, bruises brown-black, BROADLEAF not conifer, no yellow-green margin. SPARASSIS: Cauliflower form, no shelf, no yellow-green. HETEROBASIDION: White pore surface, hard woody, no yellow-green margin. UNIQUE TO PHAEOLUS: Yellow-green active margin (diagnostic - no other common fungus), conifer specialist, spongy annual bracket, brown cubical rot, degrades to fibrous rust-brown remains.	Host: Conifers (Scots pine, larch, Douglas fir, spruce). Location: Root collar and base. Texture: Soft and spongy when fresh - presses like a sponge. Annual: Appears late summer/autumn, degrades over winter. Remains: Previous year fibrous brown remains often visible near base. Rot type: Brown cubical rot - wood splits in cube-like blocks. Colour progression: Yellow-green when young -> rust-brown when old.	YELLOW-GREEN MARGIN on spongy bracket at CONIFER BASE = Phaeolus schweinitzii. Press test - if soft and spongy on a conifer = very likely Phaeolus. Remember: Phaeolus (Ph-ae-ol-us), schweinitzii (double-I at end - Schweinitz-ii). Yellow-green margin is the one unmistakable feature.	phaeolus_yellow_green
21	YES	Sparassis crispa	Cauliflower Fungus	Root plate shows brown cubical rot - wood fractures along grain, roots structurally compromised in advanced cases	Large annual fruiting body at base - PALE CREAM to yellow, multi-lobed wavy fronds forming a cauliflower or brain-like mass, no bracket or shelf form, base attached to roots or root collar	Lobed frond mass can reach 50cm diameter, entirely unlike any bracket fungus, soft fleshy texture when fresh	No visible symptoms	No visible symptoms	Crown thinning in Scots pine especially - slow progressive decline as root rot advances over years	The cauliflower-like lobed frond structure is COMPLETELY UNIQUE - there is no other common fungus that looks like this at the base of a tree. Cannot be confused with any bracket. Pale cream/yellow multi-lobed mass always at the base of conifers (especially Scots pine). Causes brown cubical rot of roots.	ALL BRACKETS: Sparassis has NO bracket or shelf form whatsoever - entirely different morphology. MERIPILUS: Overlapping fan-shaped brackets (not lobed fronds), broadleaf host. PHAEOLUS: Shelf bracket form, yellow-green margin, conifer but bracket shaped. UNIQUE TO SPARASSIS: Cauliflower/brain-like lobed frond mass - morphologically unique, impossible to confuse if seen, conifer specialist (Scots pine primarily), brown cubical rot.	Host: Scots pine primarily, occasionally other conifers. Morphology: Unlike any bracket - multi-lobed wavy fronds in a pale cream mass. Size: Large (can exceed 50cm diameter). Annual: Appears late summer/autumn. Texture: Soft fleshy when fresh, becomes tough and dark with age. Rot type: Brown cubical rot of roots and butt. Name: Crispa = curled/wavy (describes frond form). Risk: Significant - root compromise, windthrow risk.	CAULIFLOWER or BRAIN-shaped pale cream mass at CONIFER BASE = Sparassis crispa. Only answer possible - morphology is unique. If it looks like a cauliflower at the base of a pine, it is Sparassis. Remember: Sparassis (double-S, one-R), crispa (one-S, one-P - means curled). Easy marks if you learn the shape.	sparassis_cauliflower
22	YES	Trametes versicolor	Turkey Tail	No visible root symptoms - saprophyte on dead wood only	Thin bracket clusters on dead wood at base, concentric coloured zones (blue-grey, brown, cream, green-blue) in the same bracket - multicoloured pattern diagnostic	Thin brackets on dead stubs at stem base or dead lower stem wood, velvet surface on upper side, white circular pores on underside	Thin multicoloured brackets on dead branch stubs higher in crown	Numerous small thin brackets on dead branch stubs throughout crown - tree otherwise healthy or in normal decline	Crown healthy or normally aged - deadwood expected for species and age. No crown decline caused by Trametes.	Thin brackets with MULTIPLE COLOUR ZONES in blue, grey, brown, cream and sometimes green-blue in concentric rings on the SAME bracket - no other common fungus has this multicoloured zoning pattern. Strictly saprophytic - only ever on confirmed dead wood, never on living tissue. Common and often alarming to clients who assume it indicates disease. Important for client communication.	GANODERMA: Brown or grey, thick woody brackets, at base, pathogenic. BJERKANDERA: Smoky-grey pores, thin but single grey-brown tone (not multicoloured). FOMES: Grey hoof-shaped, hard woody, not multicoloured. UNIQUE TO TRAMETES: Multicoloured concentric zones (blue, grey, brown, cream - often in same bracket), thin and flexible (not woody), white circular pore surface, STRICTLY saprophytic on dead wood.	Ecology: Strictly saprophytic - colonises dead wood only, never pathogenic. Zones: Multiple colours in concentric rings - same bracket may show blue-grey, brown, cream, green-blue. Texture: Thin, flexible, velvety upper surface. Pores: White, small, circular. Significance: None - indicates deadwood (normal in maturing trees). Client value: Very commonly misidentified as disease - important to communicate it is not a threat.	THIN MULTICOLOURED BRACKETS on dead wood = Trametes versicolor. Multiple colour zones in one bracket - no other common species does this. ALWAYS check it is on DEAD wood. Important for client reassurance: NOT a disease. Remember: Trametes (one-M, one-T), versicolor (versi = varied, color = colour - the name describes it perfectly).	trametes_multicolour_zones
23	YES	Daedaleopsis confragosa	Blushing Bracket	No visible root symptoms - saprophyte and weak pathogen on dead and dying wood	Thin to medium brackets on dead or dying wood at base, grey-brown to reddish-brown upper surface with concentric zones, white to pink pore surface underneath	Brackets on lower stem, particularly at old wounds - pore surface elongated/maze-like (not circular)	Brackets at branch stubs and old wounds higher on stem	Brackets on major branches at attachment points and old pruning wounds	Crown shows localised dieback above bracket locations on dying branches - not a primary crown pathogen	The BLUSHING reaction - pore surface turns PINK to RED when rubbed or bruised - is UNIQUE among common brackets. Test in field: rub the white pore surface firmly with a finger; if it blushes pink, it is Daedaleopsis. Maze-like elongated pores (daedaloid - hence the name) on the underside rather than circular. Willow and alder specialist primarily.	TRAMETES: Multicoloured zones, circular pores, thin, does NOT blush pink. GANODERMA: Hard woody, thick, no blushing. PHELLINUS IGNIARIUS: Grey-black, extremely hard, willow host but no blushing. BJERKANDERA: Smoky-grey pores, thin, no blushing. UNIQUE TO DAEDALEOPSIS: Blushing reaction (pore surface turns pink/red when rubbed - diagnostic test), maze-like elongated pores, willow and alder host, medium thin brackets with zoned brown-red upper surface.	Host: Willow (Salix) and alder (Alnus) primarily, occasionally other broadleaves. Location: Wounds, dead branches, dying stems. Blushing test: Rub pore surface firmly - pink/red colour develops within seconds (diagnostic field test). Pores: Elongated maze-like (daedaloid) - between circular and slot-like. Ecology: Weak pathogen and saprophyte - accelerates decline of already stressed trees. Upper surface: Zoned, grey-brown to reddish-brown. Name: Daedaleopsis from Daedalus (labyrinth) - refers to maze-like pore pattern.	RUB THE PORE SURFACE - if it turns PINK = Daedaleopsis confragosa. This is the diagnostic field test and the most memorable feature. Willow or alder host supports the ID. Remember: Daedaleopsis (Daed-al-e-op-sis - five syllables, double-O before psis), confragosa (one-F, one-G). The blush test is the hook - do it in the field, teach it to clients.	daedaleopsis_blushing
24	YES	Grifola frondosa	Hen of the Woods	Root plate shows white rot decay, structural roots soft and compromised when probed	Large rosette of overlapping grey-brown brackets at base, individual brackets fan-shaped and wavy-edged, total rosette can reach 50-80cm diameter	Brackets occasionally extend onto lower stem base	No visible symptoms	No visible symptoms	Crown thinning progressive, stress symptoms evident, tree declining from root compromise upward	Large rosette of overlapping GREY-BROWN fan-shaped brackets at the base of OAK is the key combination. Visually similar to Meripilus but critically different - does NOT bruise brown or black when touched. Grey-brown upper surface (not cream-brown like Meripilus). Oak specialist. White rot of roots and butt. Annual brackets.	MERIPILUS GIGANTEUS: Cream-brown brackets, BRUISES BLACK when touched (diagnostic test separates them), wider host range. GANODERMA: Hard woody hoof or shelf, not rosette form, perennial. PHAEOLUS: Yellow-green margin, conifer host, spongy texture. UNIQUE TO GRIFOLA: Grey-brown overlapping fan rosette, does NOT bruise (unlike Meripilus), oak specialist, white rot, annual, wavy irregular bracket edges.	Host: Oak (Quercus) primarily, occasionally other broadleaves. Location: Root collar and base. Form: Rosette of overlapping fan-shaped brackets - similar habit to Meripilus but grey-brown not cream-brown. Bruising test: No colour change when rubbed (Meripilus bruises black - key separation). Annual: Appears late summer/autumn. Decay: White rot of roots and butt. Failure: Windthrow risk.	GREY-BROWN ROSETTE at OAK BASE - rub it. If NO bruising = Grifola frondosa. If bruises BLACK = Meripilus giganteus. That bruise test is the single most important separation between these two. Remember: Grifola (one-R, one-F), frondosa (frond-like - describes the overlapping bracket form). Oak host + no bruising = Grifola.	grifola_grey_rosette
25	YES	Phellinus pomaceus	Cushion Bracket	No visible root symptoms	Hard perennial brackets on stem or at base of apple, hawthorn or plum - grey-brown to rust-brown upper surface, very hard texture, irregular cushion or hoof form	Brackets at old pruning wounds or canker sites on lower stem, hard woody texture, rust-brown lower surface when broken	Brackets common on upper stem and major scaffold branches at old wounds and pruning cuts	Brackets at branch attachment points and old pruning scars - tree shows dieback above bracket locations	Crown dieback in sectors above bracket locations - progressive loss of scaffold branches, localised decline rather than whole-crown failure	Hard perennial brackets specifically on APPLE, HAWTHORN, CHERRY or PLUM (Rosaceae family trees) is the key trigger. Pomaceus literally means of the apple - the host family is the diagnostic clue. Same hard bracket form as other Phellinus species but the Rosaceae host is unique among common brackets. Causes white rot of heartwood at wound sites.	PHELLINUS IGNIARIUS: Grey-black, willow/poplar host (not Rosaceae). PHELLINUS PINI: Conifer host, entirely different. GANODERMA: Brown, root-base location, not wound-associated. INONOTUS HISPIDUS: Hairy surface, ash host, annual. UNIQUE TO PHELLINUS POMACEUS: Rosaceae host (apple, hawthorn, cherry, plum) is diagnostic - no other common Phellinus on these hosts, bracket at wounds and pruning cuts, hard perennial cushion form, white rot.	Host: Rosaceae - apple (Malus), hawthorn (Crataegus), cherry and plum (Prunus), pear (Pyrus). Location: Old wounds, pruning cuts, canker sites on stem and branches. Decay: White rot of heartwood. Brackets: Hard perennial cushion to hoof form. Texture: Extremely hard woody. Significance: Common on orchard and hedgerow trees, veteran hawthorn especially. Name: Pomaceus = of the pome fruits (apple family).	HARD BRACKET on APPLE, HAWTHORN or PLUM = Phellinus pomaceus. The host family (Rosaceae) is the single biggest clue - no other common Phellinus grows on these trees. Three Phellinus on exam list: igniarius (willow), pomaceus (apple/hawthorn), pini (pine) - host is everything for this genus. Remember: Phellinus (double-L), pomaceus (one-M, one-C).	phellinus_pomaceus_rosaceae
26	YES	Phellinus pini	Pine Bracket	No visible root symptoms - heartwood decay not root decay	Brackets occasionally at base of pine, grey-black to rust-brown irregular hoof or cushion form, very hard texture, rust-brown when broken internally	Brackets on lower stem at resin pockets or old wounds, resin may exude around bracket base - hard perennial form	Brackets common on upper stem - heartwood decay extends through stem, resin flow visible on bark near brackets	Brackets at branch scars and attachment points in upper crown, multiple brackets at different heights on same tree	Crown shows progressive thinning and deadwood - resin flow on stem near brackets is a supporting clue	Hard perennial brackets at MULTIPLE HEIGHTS on PINE stem combined with RESIN FLOW on bark near brackets is the trigger. Causes a column of heartwood decay tracking upward through the stem - unlike butt rot pathogens, decay is not confined to the base. Pine specialist. Multiple brackets at various stem heights on the same tree is characteristic.	PHELLINUS IGNIARIUS: Grey-black, willow host (not pine). PHELLINUS POMACEUS: Rosaceae host (not conifer). FOMITOPSIS PINICOLA: Red-brown margin, conifer but brown rot and different bracket form. HETEROBASIDION: White crust at base, root rot not heartwood. UNIQUE TO PHELLINUS PINI: Pine specialist, heartwood column decay (not butt/root), multiple brackets at various heights on same stem, resin flow at bracket sites diagnostic.	Host: Pine (Pinus) primarily - Scots pine most commonly in UK/Ireland. Location: Main stem at various heights - NOT primarily at base. Decay: White rot of heartwood forming a column through stem. Resin: Exudate around bracket base on pine - diagnostic supporting clue. Brackets: Perennial, very hard, multiple on same stem. Failure: Stem snap at heavily decayed section. Name: Pini = of the pine.	MULTIPLE HARD BRACKETS at VARIOUS HEIGHTS on PINE STEM = Phellinus pini. Resin flow near brackets supports ID. Three Phellinus on exam list - host separates them every time: igniarius (willow), pomaceus (apple/hawthorn), pini (pine). Remember: Phellinus (double-L), pini (simply pine in Latin). Heartwood column decay = failure can occur anywhere along stem, not just base.	phellinus_pini_stem
27	YES	Pholiota squarrosa	Shaggy Scalycap	Roots show early decay at collar in advanced cases - soft white rot when probed	Clusters of mushrooms at base or from buried roots - tawny yellow-brown cap covered in distinctive upturned dry scales, ring present on stem, garlicky smell	Mushroom clusters emerging from bark fissures or wounds on lower stem - same scaly cap pattern	Clusters can emerge from wounds higher on stem	Clusters of scaly mushrooms occasionally at major branch unions or wounds	Crown shows stress in advanced cases - thinning and dieback above heavily infected stem areas	Clustered mushrooms (not brackets) with UPTURNED DRY SCALES covering a tawny-yellow cap is completely diagnostic. No bracket fungus has this appearance. The dry recurved scales on cap and stem are unmistakable. Garlicky unpleasant smell. Causes white rot of heartwood and roots. Important distinction - it is a mushroom form, not a bracket.	ARMILLARIA: Mushroom form but smooth honey-brown cap with white mycelial fans and rhizomorphs - NO dry upturned scales. HYPHOLOMA: Yellow-green clustered mushrooms, NO scales. ALL BRACKETS: Pholiota has no bracket form whatsoever. UNIQUE TO PHOLIOTA SQUARROSA: Dry upturned scales covering cap and stem (squarrosa = rough with scales), tawny-yellow colour, clustered habit, garlicky smell - combination unique among tree pathogens.	Form: Mushroom (not bracket) - note clearly in inspection reports. Cap: Tawny yellow-brown, densely covered in dry upturned recurved scales. Stem: Also scaly below the ring. Smell: Distinctive garlicky/unpleasant odour - useful field clue. Gills: Pale yellow becoming rusty-brown. Growth: Clustered at base, root collars, stem wounds. Decay: White rot of heartwood and root collar. Host: Wide range - oak, beech, birch, fruit trees. Name: Squarrosa = rough with projecting scales.	DRY UPTURNED SCALES on tawny-yellow CLUSTERED MUSHROOMS at tree base = Pholiota squarrosa. No bracket fungus looks like this - the scaling is unique. Garlicky smell confirms in field. Mushroom form not bracket - note this in reports. Remember: Pholiota (Ph-ol-i-ota), squarrosa (double-R, double-S - describes the rough scaly surface).	pholiota_squarrosa_scaly
28	YES	Pseudoinonotus dryadeus	Weeping Oak Polypore	Root collar shows extensive decay, soft and crumbly when probed, roots compromised in excavation	Brackets at root collar - rough irregular surface, AMBER DROPLETS visible on upper surface (weeping appearance), bracket underside pores rust-brown, soft when fresh hardening with age	No brackets typically present on lower stem	No visible symptoms	No visible symptoms	Crown density 80%, appears healthy despite severe root decay at collar	AMBER DROPLETS weeping from the bracket surface are DIAGNOSTIC - no other common fungus produces this amber exudate. Root collar location specific. Rust-brown pore surface distinctive. Causes severe root and collar decay while crown remains deceptively healthy. Oak specialist. Current accepted name is Pseudoinonotus dryadeus - use this in exam answers.	GANODERMA: Hoof or shelf form, NO amber droplets, white pores, brown spores. MERIPILUS: Rosette form, brown bruising, NO droplets. GRIFOLA: Grey-brown rosette, no droplets. UNIQUE TO PSEUDOINONOTUS: Amber droplets (weeping - unique to this species), root collar location, rough irregular bracket, rust-brown pores, oak association.	Host: Primarily oak (Quercus), occasionally sweet chestnut. Location: Root collar specifically - not higher on stem. Droplets: Amber liquid exudate on young brackets (may dry in older specimens - check for amber staining if droplets absent). Decay: White rot of roots and root collar, severe anchorage loss. Failure: Windthrow risk high. Taxonomy: Current name Pseudoinonotus dryadeus. Dryadeus refers to dryads (oak tree spirits).	AMBER DROPLETS on bracket at OAK ROOT COLLAR = Pseudoinonotus dryadeus. Droplets are unique - no other common fungus has them. If older bracket with no droplets, check for dried amber staining. Use Pseudoinonotus dryadeus in exam answers - current accepted name. Remember: Pseudoinonotus (Pseudo-in-on-otus), dryadeus (dryad = oak spirit). Amber weeping = only one answer.	pseudoinonotus_amber_droplets
29	YES	Rigidoporus ulmarius	Large Pored Polypore	Root plate shows white rot decay, roots soft when probed, structural anchorage compromised	Large pale cream to buff perennial brackets at base - hard woody texture, LARGE ANGULAR PORES visible on underside (visibly larger than Ganoderma pores), pale buff-cream upper surface, no brown spore deposits	Brackets extend onto lower stem, same pale cream colour and large angular pore surface	No visible symptoms	No visible symptoms	Crown thinning progressive - tree declining from below while upper crown appears relatively healthy	Pale cream to buff colour combined with LARGE ANGULAR PORES on the underside separates Rigidoporus from all Ganoderma species at a glance. No brown spore deposits (unlike Ganoderma). Hard perennial bracket. Elm specialist historically, now beech, oak and other broadleaves. White rot of roots causes windthrow while crown remains deceptively healthy.	GANODERMA AUSTRALE: Brown hoof (not pale cream), smaller circular pores, heavy brown spore deposits. GANODERMA APPLANATUM: Grey-brown flat shelf, smaller pores, brown spore deposits. PERENNIPORIA FRAXINEA: Pale buff but ash host, smaller brackets. UNIQUE TO RIGIDOPORUS: Pale cream/buff colour (not brown), LARGE ANGULAR PORES (largest common pore openings - visible to naked eye), no spore deposits, hard perennial, elm/beech association, white rot of roots.	Host: Elm (Ulmus) historically - now beech (Fagus), oak (Quercus) and other broadleaves. Location: Root collar and base. Colour: Pale cream to buff - distinctively pale, not brown like Ganoderma. Pores: Large angular openings visible to naked eye - diagnostic. Brackets: Perennial, hard woody, often large. Spores: No significant deposits (unlike Ganoderma). Decay: White rot of roots and butt. Failure: Windthrow. Name: Ulmarius = of the elm.	PALE CREAM bracket with LARGE ANGULAR PORES at broadleaf base = Rigidoporus ulmarius. Check pore size - visibly larger than Ganoderma. No brown spore deposits separates it cleanly from all Ganoderma. Remember: Rigidoporus (Rigid-o-porus - rigid, describes hard bracket), ulmarius (ulm = elm). Pale colour + large pores = only Rigidoporus.	rigidoporus_large_pores
