1	YES	Armillaria mellea	Honey Fungus	"Extensive white mycelial fans visible under bark at root collar when bark peeled, firm texture, spreading pattern"	"Black rhizomorphs (bootlaces) visible in soil radiating from base, 2-4mm diameter, tough and string-like"	No visible external symptoms on bark surface	No visible external symptoms	No visible symptoms on branches	"Progressive crown thinning starting in upper crown, 45% density, leaves smaller than normal, premature autumn color"	The combination of white mycelial fans under bark PLUS black rhizomorphs in soil is DIAGNOSTIC for Armillaria. No other fungus produces bootlace-like rhizomorphs. Crown thinning without lower stem symptoms indicates root/vascular compromise from below. Often no fruiting bodies visible when symptoms appear.	"GANODERMA: Has woody brackets at base, NO rhizomorphs, brown spore deposits. INONOTUS DRYADEUS: Amber droplets on brackets, NO rhizomorphs. MERIPILUS: Large rosette fruiting bodies with brown bruising, NO rhizomorphs. UNIQUE TO ARMILLARIA: Rhizomorphs are unique (only this genus), white mycelial fans under bark, mushroomy smell when bark peeled, often no visible fruiting when tree symptomatic."	"Smell: Strong mushroomy odor under bark when peeled. Progression: Can kill trees in 2-5 years or persist for decades depending on host vigor. Host range: Very wide (most broadleaves and conifers susceptible). Spread: Root-to-root contact underground. Risk level: HIGH - aggressive pathogen, can spread through tree populations."	"If you see ""rhizomorphs"" or ""bootlaces"" in exam question ? ALWAYS Armillaria (no other fungus has these). If ""mycelial fans under bark at collar"" ? likely Armillaria, definitive if rhizomorphs also present. Remember double-L in Armillaria and double-L in mellea."	armillaria_fans_rhizomorphs
2	YES	Ganoderma australe	Southern Bracket	"Root flare shows soft fibrous white rot when probed, spongy texture, structural roots affected in excavation"	"Large hoof-shaped perennial brackets present, concentrically zoned brown upper surface, white margin when actively growing, hard and woody texture"	"White pore surface on underside of brackets, brown spore deposits visible on ground or lower bark below brackets"	No visible symptoms	No visible symptoms	"Crown density 70-80%, appears relatively healthy despite root decay"	Brown spore deposits on ground beneath brackets are diagnostic for Ganoderma genus. Hoof-shaped woody brackets with zoned brown surface distinguish G. australe. Root decay causes windthrow risk while crown appears deceptively healthy (roots fail before vascular function compromised). White fibrous rot in roots typical.	"GANODERMA APPLANATUM: Flat shelf-like brackets (not hoof-shaped), thinner, grey-brown color. GANODERMA RESINACEUM: Resinous coating on bracket surface. MERIPILUS: Rosette form at base, brown bruising diagnostic. INONOTUS DRYADEUS: Amber droplets, rough bracket surface. UNIQUE TO G. AUSTRALE: Hoof-shaped form, zoned brown surface, hard woody texture, heavy spore deposits, white pore surface."	"Location: Root collar and root flare, rarely higher on stem. Decay type: White rot of roots (soft, fibrous, stringy). Failure mode: Windthrow most common (roots fail). Crown condition: Often healthy appearance until failure (misleading). Spores: Prolific brown spore production creates deposits. Growth: Perennial brackets add new layer each year."	"Look for HOOF-SHAPED bracket = G. australe. If FLAT shelf = G. applanatum. Heavy brown spore deposits = Ganoderma genus (multiple species possible). Remember: Ganoderma has two N's, australe has no double letters. ""Australe"" means ""southern"" - remember ""Australia"" connection."	ganoderma_australe_hoof
3	YES	Ganoderma applanatum	Artist's Bracket	"Root plate excavation shows white rot in structural roots, stringy fibrous texture"	"Large flat shelf-like brackets at base, grey-brown upper surface (not zoned), overlapping tiers possible, very hard woody texture"	"Brackets can extend up lower stem, flat shelf form continues, brown spore deposits accumulate on lower bark"	No visible symptoms	No visible symptoms	"Crown 75% density, foliage appears healthy despite root compromise"	Flat shelf-like brackets distinguish G. applanatum from hoof-shaped G. australe. Grey-brown (not concentrically zoned brown) upper surface diagnostic. White pore surface browns when scratched (artist's bracket name origin). Massive brown spore production creates heavy deposits. Root rot while crown healthy = typical Ganoderma pattern.	"GANODERMA AUSTRALE: Hoof-shaped (not flat), zoned brown surface. GANODERMA RESINACEUM: Resinous coating. FOMES FOMENTARIUS: Grey hoof-shaped, on beech, higher on stem. POLYPORUS SQUAMOSUS: Scaly cap, cream pores, distinct stalk. UNIQUE TO G. APPLANATUM: Flat shelf form, grey-brown color (not zoned), white pore surface browns when scratched, can draw on pore surface (artist's use)."	"Location: Base and lower stem, can extend higher than G. australe. Size: Very large brackets possible (30-50cm diameter). Spores: Prolific spore production, brown deposits diagnostic. Pore surface: White, browns permanently when scratched (artwork surface). Multiple tiers: Often overlapping shelf brackets. Annual growth: Perennial, new pore layer each year."	"FLAT shelf = G. applanatum. HOOF-shaped = G. australe. Scratch test: If white pore surface browns when scratched = G. applanatum (diagnostic test). Remember spelling: applanatum has double-P, double-N. Think ""apple-anus"" for weird memory trick."	ganoderma_applanatum_shelf
4	YES	Inonotus dryadeus	Weeping Oak Polypore	"Root collar shows extensive decay, soft and crumbly when probed, roots compromised in excavation"	"Brackets at root collar, rough surface texture, amber droplets visible (weeping appearance), bracket underside pores rust-brown"	No brackets typically present on lower stem	No visible symptoms	No visible symptoms	"Crown density 80%, appears healthy despite severe root decay"	Amber droplets on bracket surface are DIAGNOSTIC - no other common fungus has this weeping appearance. Root collar location specific. Rust-brown pore surface distinctive. Causes severe root decay while crown remains deceptively healthy. Oak specialist (occasionally other broadleaves).	"GANODERMA: Hoof or shelf form, NO amber droplets, white pores, brown spores. MERIPILUS: Rosette form, brown bruising, NO droplets. POLYPORUS SQUAMOSUS: Scaly cap, cream pores, stalk present, NO droplets. UNIQUE TO INONOTUS DRYADEUS: Amber droplets (unique weeping), root collar location, rough irregular bracket, rust-brown pores, oak association."	"Host: Primarily oak (Quercus), occasionally sweet chestnut. Location: Root collar specifically (not higher stem). Droplets: Amber liquid exudate on young brackets (may dry in older brackets). Decay: White rot of roots, severe anchorage loss. Failure: Windthrow risk high. Smell: No distinctive odor. Progression: Slow, tree may survive years with extensive decay."	"If you see ""amber droplets"" or ""weeping"" on brackets ? ALWAYS Inonotus dryadeus (unique feature). ""Dryadeus"" refers to dryads (oak tree spirits) - oak association. Remember: Inonotus has one-N, dryadeus has Y not I in middle. Droplets = diagnostic clincher."	inonotus_dryadeus_droplets

Brown/black bruising when bracket touched (fresh brackets) - unique identifier. Very large overall size (can exceed 1m diameter rosette). Annual fruiting (not perennial like Ganoderma). Causes severe root decay and windthrow risk.	"GANODERMA: Hoof or shelf form (not rosette), hard woody texture, perennial, NO bruising. INONOTUS DRYADEUS: Smaller brackets, amber droplets, NO bruising. POLYPORUS SQUAMOSUS: Individual stalked brackets, scaly cap, NO bruising, cream pores. UNIQUE TO MERIPILUS: Rosette form, brown/black bruising when touched (diagnostic), very large size, annual brackets (soft texture), cream-brown pore surface."	"Fruiting: Annual (appears late summer/autumn, degrades over winter). Size: Very large rosettes, impressive when fully developed. Bruising: Fresh brackets bruise brown/black when handled (diagnostic test). Decay: White rot of roots and root collar. Failure mode: Windthrow. Smell: No strong odor. Previous fruiting: Check for old degraded brackets from previous years (fibrous remains)."	"If description says ""bruises brown/black when touched"" ? ALWAYS Meripilus (unique feature among common fungi). ""Giganteus"" = giant size. Rosette form diagnostic. Remember: Meripilus has one-R, giganteus has one-G. Bruising test = quick ID in field."	meripilus_rosette_bruising
6	YES	Kretzschmaria deusta	Brittle Cinder	No visible root symptoms typically	"Grey powdery patches on bark at base, progressing to black crusty stromata, bark loose and easily removed, tissue beneath dark and brittle"	"Black crusty stromata extend up lower stem, can cover 180-270° of circumference, bark falls away revealing black tissue"	Extension of stromata may reach 2-3m height in advanced cases	No visible symptoms	"Crown thinning and dieback in advanced stages, leaves smaller, premature yellowing"	"Grey to black stromata progression diagnostic (grey powdery stage progresses to black crusty hard stage). Causes uniquely BRITTLE decay (ceramic-like fracture). Most dangerous decay fungus due to sudden failure with minimal warning. Affects stem not roots. Often called ""brittle cinder"" or ""Ustulina deusta"" (older name)."	"ARMILLARIA: White fans + rhizomorphs, NO stromata, affects roots. GANODERMA: Brackets present, affects roots, NOT brittle. BJERKANDERA: Small thin brackets on deadwood, NOT brittle, saprophytic. UNIQUE TO KRETZSCHMARIA: Grey-to-black stromata progression, causes BRITTLE decay (unique), sudden failure mode, stem-based (not root), most dangerous common fungus, minimal external symptoms until late."	Progression: Grey powdery ? black crusty stromata. Decay type: Soft rot causing BRITTLE ceramic-like fracture. Failure mode: Sudden catastrophic snap (no warning). Location: Lower stem primarily (not roots). Danger level: HIGHEST - unpredictable sudden failure. Warning: Healthy crown appearance until very late stage (misleading). Speed: Relatively fast progression once established. Old name: Ustulina deusta (synonym still used).	"If description includes ""brittle"" or ""ceramic fracture"" ? ALWAYS Kretzschmaria (unique decay type). Grey-to-black progression diagnostic. Most dangerous common fungus = emergency removal usually required. Remember: Kretzschmaria has unusual spelling (K-r-e-t-z), ""deusta"" means ""burnt"" (black appearance). Also called Ustulina deusta (old name) - know both."	kretzschmaria_black_stromata

"Host: Beech primarily (occasionally birch, other broadleaves). Location: Main stem at various heights (NOT typically at base like Ganoderma). Decay: White rot of heartwood (slow progression). Brackets: Perennial, add layer annually, very hard. Historical use: Used as tinder for fire-starting (punk wood). Size: Medium (10-20cm typical). Color: Distinctive grey (not brown like Ganoderma)."	"GREY hoof on BEECH STEM = Fomes fomentarius. BROWN hoof at BASE = Ganoderma. Location key to separation. Remember: ""Fomes"" = tinder (fire starting), ""fomentarius"" = same root. Grey color + beech host = diagnostic combination. One-M in Fomes."	fomes_fomentarius_grey_hoof
8	YES	Inonotus hispidus	Shaggy Bracket	No visible root symptoms	No brackets typically at base	"Brackets appear on main stem, rough hairy upper surface, rust-brown color, soft velvety texture when young, becoming harder with age"	"Brackets common on upper stem at old branch stubs or wounds, irregular bracket shape"	Brackets at branch attachment points on larger scaffold branches	"Crown shows dieback in areas above bracket locations, dead branches evident, thinning in affected sectors"	"Rough hairy/shaggy bracket surface diagnostic (hispid = hairy).
