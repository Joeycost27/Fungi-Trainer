1	YES	Armillaria mellea	Honey Fungus	"Extensive white mycelial fans visible under bark at root collar when bark peeled, firm texture, spreading pattern"	"Black rhizomorphs (bootlaces) visible in soil radiating from base, 2-4mm diameter, tough and string-like"	No visible external symptoms on bark surface	No visible external symptoms	No visible symptoms on branches	"Progressive crown thinning starting in upper crown, 45% density, leaves smaller than normal, premature autumn color"	The combination of white mycelial fans under bark PLUS black rhizomorphs in soil is DIAGNOSTIC for Armillaria. No other fungus produces bootlace-like rhizomorphs. Crown thinning without lower stem symptoms indicates root/vascular compromise from below. Often no fruiting bodies visible when symptoms appear.	"GANODERMA: Has woody brackets at base, NO rhizomorphs, brown spore deposits. INONOTUS DRYADEUS: Amber droplets on brackets, NO rhizomorphs. MERIPILUS: Large rosette fruiting bodies with brown bruising, NO rhizomorphs. UNIQUE TO ARMILLARIA: Rhizomorphs are unique (only this genus), white mycelial fans under bark, mushroomy smell when bark peeled, often no visible fruiting when tree symptomatic."	"Smell: Strong mushroomy odor under bark when peeled. Progression: Can kill trees in 2-5 years or persist for decades depending on host vigor. Host range: Very wide (most broadleaves and conifers susceptible). Spread: Root-to-root contact underground. Risk level: HIGH - aggressive pathogen, can spread through tree populations."	"If you see ""rhizomorphs"" or ""bootlaces"" in exam question ? ALWAYS Armillaria (no other fungus has these). If ""mycelial fans under bark at collar"" ? likely Armillaria, definitive if rhizomorphs also present. Remember double-L in Armillaria and double-L in mellea."	armillaria_fans_rhizomorphs
2	YES	Ganoderma australe	Southern Bracket	"Root flare shows soft fibrous white rot when probed, spongy texture, structural roots affected in excavation"	"Large hoof-shaped perennial brackets present, concentrically zoned brown upper surface, white margin when actively growing, hard and woody texture"	"White pore surface on underside of brackets, brown spore deposits visible on ground or lower bark below brackets"	No visible symptoms	No visible symptoms	"Crown density 70-80%, appears relatively healthy despite root decay"	Brown spore deposits on ground beneath brackets are diagnostic for Ganoderma genus. Hoof-shaped woody brackets with zoned brown surface distinguish G. australe. Root decay causes windthrow risk while crown appears deceptively healthy (roots fail before vascular function compromised). White fibrous rot in roots typical.	"GANODERMA APPLANATUM: Flat shelf-like brackets (not hoof-shaped), thinner, grey-brown color. GANODERMA RESINACEUM: Resinous coating on bracket surface. MERIPILUS: Rosette form at base, brown bruising diagnostic. INONOTUS DRYADEUS: Amber droplets, rough bracket surface. UNIQUE TO G. AUSTRALE: Hoof-shaped form, zoned brown surface, hard woody texture, heavy spore deposits, white pore surface."	"Location: Root collar and root flare, rarely higher on stem. Decay type: White rot of roots (soft, fibrous, stringy). Failure mode: Windthrow most common (roots fail). Crown condition: Often healthy appearance until failure (misleading). Spores: Prolific brown spore production creates deposits. Growth: Perennial brackets add new layer each year."	"Look for HOOF-SHAPED bracket = G. australe. If FLAT shelf = G. applanatum. Heavy brown spore deposits = Ganoderma genus (multiple species possible). Remember: Ganoderma has two N's, australe has no double letters. ""Australe"" means ""southern"" - remember ""Australia"" connection."	ganoderma_australe_hoof
3	YES	Ganoderma applanatum	Artist's Bracket	"Root plate excavation shows white rot in structural roots, stringy fibrous texture"	"Large flat shelf-like brackets at base, grey-brown upper surface (not zoned), overlapping tiers possible, very hard woody texture"	"Brackets can extend up lower stem, flat shelf form continues, brown spore deposits accumulate on lower bark"	No visible symptoms	No visible symptoms	"Crown 75% density, foliage appears healthy despite root compromise"	Flat shelf-like brackets distinguish G. applanatum from hoof-shaped G. australe. Grey-brown (not concentrically zoned brown) upper surface diagnostic. White pore surface browns when scratched (artist's bracket name origin). Massive brown spore production creates heavy deposits. Root rot while crown healthy = typical Ganoderma pattern.	"GANODERMA AUSTRALE: Hoof-shaped (not flat), zoned brown surface. GANODERMA RESINACEUM: Resinous coating. FOMES FOMENTARIUS: Grey hoof-shaped, on beech, higher on stem. POLYPORUS SQUAMOSUS: Scaly cap, cream pores, distinct stalk. UNIQUE TO G. APPLANATUM: Flat shelf form, grey-brown color (not zoned), white pore surface browns when scratched, can draw on pore surface (artist's use)."	"Location: Base and lower stem, can extend higher than G. australe. Size: Very large brackets possible (30-50cm diameter). Spores: Prolific spore production, brown deposits diagnostic. Pore surface: White, browns permanently when scratched (artwork surface). Multiple tiers: Often overlapping shelf brackets. Annual growth: Perennial, new pore layer each year."	"FLAT shelf = G. applanatum. HOOF-shaped = G. australe. Scratch test: If white pore surface browns when scratched = G. applanatum (diagnostic test). Remember spelling: applanatum has double-P, double-N. Think ""apple-anus"" for weird memory trick."	ganoderma_applanatum_shelf
4	YES	Inonotus dryadeus	Weeping Oak Polypore	"Root collar shows extensive decay, soft and crumbly when probed, roots compromised in excavation"	"Brackets at root collar, rough surface texture, amber droplets visible (weeping appearance), bracket underside pores rust-brown"	No brackets typically present on lower stem	No visible symptoms	No visible symptoms	"Crown density 80%, appears healthy despite severe root decay"	Amber droplets on bracket surface are DIAGNOSTIC - no other common fungus has this weeping appearance. Root collar location specific. Rust-brown pore surface distinctive. Causes severe root decay while crown remains deceptively healthy. Oak specialist (occasionally other broadleaves).	"GANODERMA: Hoof or shelf form, NO amber droplets, white pores, brown spores. MERIPILUS: Rosette form, brown bruising, NO droplets. POLYPORUS SQUAMOSUS: Scaly cap, cream pores, stalk present, NO droplets. UNIQUE TO INONOTUS DRYADEUS: Amber droplets (unique weeping), root collar location, rough irregular bracket, rust-brown pores, oak association."	"Host: Primarily oak (Quercus), occasionally sweet chestnut. Location: Root collar specifically (not higher stem). Droplets: Amber liquid exudate on young brackets (may dry in older brackets). Decay: White rot of roots, severe anchorage loss. Failure: Windthrow risk high. Smell: No distinctive odor. Progression: Slow, tree may survive years with extensive decay."	"If you see ""amber droplets"" or ""weeping"" on brackets ? ALWAYS Inonotus dryadeus (unique feature). ""Dryadeus"" refers to dryads (oak tree spirits) - oak association.

Brown/black bruising when bracket touched (fresh brackets) - unique identifier. Very large overall size (can exceed 1m diameter rosette). Annual fruiting (not perennial like Ganoderma). Causes severe root decay and windthrow risk.	"GANODERMA: Hoof or shelf form (not rosette), hard woody texture, perennial, NO bruising. INONOTUS DRYADEUS: Smaller brackets, amber droplets, NO bruising. POLYPORUS SQUAMOSUS: Individual stalked brackets, scaly cap, NO bruising, cream pores. UNIQUE TO MERIPILUS: Rosette form, brown/black bruising when touched (diagnostic), very large size, annual brackets (soft texture), cream-brown pore surface."	"Fruiting: Annual (appears late summer/autumn, degrades over winter). Size: Very large rosettes, impressive when fully developed. Bruising: Fresh brackets bruise brown/black when handled (diagnostic test). Decay: White rot of roots and root collar. Failure mode: Windthrow. Smell: No strong odor. Previous fruiting: Check for old degraded brackets from previous years (fibrous remains)."	"If description says ""bruises brown/black when touched"" ? ALWAYS Meripilus (unique feature among common fungi). ""Giganteus"" = giant size. Rosette form diagnostic. Remember: Meripilus has one-R, giganteus has one-G. Bruising test = quick ID in field."	meripilus_rosette_bruising
6	YES	Kretzschmaria deusta	Brittle Cinder	No visible root symptoms typically	"Grey powdery patches on bark at base, progressing to black crusty stromata, bark loose and easily removed, tissue beneath dark and brittle"	"Black crusty stromata extend up lower stem, can cover 180-270° of circumference, bark falls away revealing black tissue"	Extension of stromata may reach 2-3m height in advanced cases	No visible symptoms	"Crown thinning and dieback in advanced stages, leaves smaller, premature yellowing"	"Grey to black stromata progression diagnostic (grey powdery stage progresses to black crusty hard stage). Causes uniquely BRITTLE decay (ceramic-like fracture). Most dangerous decay fungus due to sudden failure with minimal warning. Affects stem not roots. Often called ""brittle cinder"" or ""Ustulina deusta"" (older name)."	"ARMILLARIA: White fans + rhizomorphs, NO stromata, affects roots. GANODERMA: Brackets present, affects roots, NOT brittle. BJERKANDERA: Small thin brackets on deadwood, NOT brittle, saprophytic. UNIQUE TO KRETZSCHMARIA: Grey-to-black stromata progression, causes BRITTLE decay (unique), sudden failure mode, stem-based (not root), most dangerous common fungus, minimal external symptoms until late."	Progression: Grey powdery ? black crusty stromata. Decay type: Soft rot causing BRITTLE ceramic-like fracture. Failure mode: Sudden catastrophic snap (no warning). Location: Lower stem primarily (not roots). Danger level: HIGHEST - unpredictable sudden failure. Warning: Healthy crown appearance until very late stage (misleading). Speed: Relatively fast progression once established. Old name: Ustulina deusta (synonym still used).	"If description includes ""brittle"" or ""ceramic fracture"" ? ALWAYS Kretzschmaria (unique decay type). Grey-to-black progression diagnostic. Most dangerous common fungus = emergency removal usually required. Remember: Kretzschmaria has unusual spelling (K-r-e-t-z), ""deusta"" means ""burnt"" (black appearance). Also called Ustulina deusta (old name) - know both."	kretzschmaria_black_stromata

19	YES	Heterobasidion annosum	Root Rot / Butt Rot	"White mycelial mat visible under bark at root collar of conifers when lifted, resinous smell, resin soaking into surrounding soil"	"Irregular shelf-like fruiting body at base of conifer, pale cream/white pore surface on underside, brown-grey irregular upper surface, hard and woody"	"White resinous decay visible in basal wood when probed, no obvious external symptoms on bark surface"	No visible symptoms	No visible symptoms	"Crown thinning and yellowing in Scots pine, needle drop, resin flow on stem — tree declining from below while upper crown still appears partially active"	The white pore surface and cream-white irregular bracket at the BASE OF CONIFERS is the key combination. No rhizomorphs (unlike Armillaria). No amber droplets. Causes devastating butt and root rot in conifer plantations — most economically destructive forest pathogen in Europe. Resinous smell and resin-soaked soil are supporting clues.	"ARMILLARIA: Rhizomorphs present, white mycelial fans, affects broadleaves and conifers. PHAEOLUS: Yellow-green active margin, annual, spongy texture. SPARASSIS: Cauliflower form, no shelf bracket. UNIQUE TO HETEROBASIDION: White/cream irregular pore surface at conifer base, no rhizomorphs, resin-soaking diagnostic, devastating plantation pathogen, spread via root contact and airborne spores to fresh stumps."	"Host: Conifers primarily (Scots pine, Norway spruce, Douglas fir, larch). Spread: Root-to-root contact AND airborne spores colonising fresh cut stumps — stump treatment mandatory after felling in infected stands. Decay: White rot of butt and roots. Risk: Catastrophic in plantations — can render entire stands unstable. Detection: Often no external symptoms until advanced decay. Legal: Stump treatment legally required in some forestry contexts."	"WHITE irregular bracket/crust at CONIFER BASE = Heterobasidion annosum until proven otherwise. No rhizomorphs separates it from Armillaria. CONIFER host is the first filter — if broadleaf, look elsewhere. Remember: Heterobasidion (three syllables: Het-er-o-bas-id-i-on), annosum (one-N, one-S). Stump treatment knowledge likely to appear in exam context."	heterobasidion_white_crust
20	YES	Phaeolus schweinitzii	Dyer's Mazegill	"Root plate shows brown cubical rot when probed — wood fractures in cube-like blocks, structural roots compromised"	"Large annual bracket at base, velvety surface, yellow-green to rust-brown coloring with distinctive YELLOW-GREEN actively growing outer margin, spongy and soft when fresh"	"Bracket can extend onto lower stem, same yellow-green margin visible, degrades rapidly — fibrous remains from previous years may be visible"	No visible symptoms	No visible symptoms	"Crown shows progressive thinning, needle drop in conifers, deadwood in lower crown sections — tree declining from root compromise"	The YELLOW-GREEN growing margin on a large spongy annual bracket at the base of CONIFERS is unique — no other common fungus has this combination. Soft and spongy when fresh (can be pressed with finger). Causes brown cubical rot (wood fractures in cubes — not stringy like white rot). Degrades to fibrous brown remains over winter — old bracket remains are a supporting clue.	"MERIPILUS: Rosette of overlapping brackets, bruises brown-black, BROADLEAF not conifer, no yellow-green margin. SPARASSIS: Cauliflower form, no shelf, no yellow-green. HETEROBASIDION: White pore surface, hard woody, no yellow-green margin. UNIQUE TO PHAEOLUS: Yellow-green active margin (diagnostic — no other common fungus), conifer specialist, spongy annual bracket, brown cubical rot, degrades to fibrous rust-brown remains."	"Host: Conifers (Scots pine, larch, Douglas fir, spruce). Location: Root collar and base. Texture: Soft and spongy when fresh — presses like a sponge. Annual: Appears late summer/autumn, degrades over winter. Remains: Previous year fibrous brown remains often visible near base. Rot type: Brown cubical rot — wood splits along and across grain in cube-like blocks. Color progression: Yellow-green when young → rust-brown when old. Named for mycologist Lewis David de Schweinitz."	"YELLOW-GREEN MARGIN on spongy bracket at CONIFER BASE = Phaeolus schweinitzii. If the bracket is soft and spongy (press it) and growing on a conifer = very likely Phaeolus. Press test useful in field. Remember: Phaeolus (Ph-ae-ol-us), schweinitzii (double-I at end — Schweinitz-ii). Yellow-green is the one unmistakable feature — learn the color."	phaeolus_yellow_green
21	YES	Sparassis crispa	Cauliflower Fungus	"Root plate shows brown cubical rot — wood fractures along grain, roots structurally compromised in advanced cases"	"Large annual fruiting body at base — PALE CREAM to yellow, multi-lobed wavy fronds forming a cauliflower or brain-like mass, no bracket or shelf form, base attached to roots or root collar"	"Lobed frond mass can reach 50cm diameter, entirely unlike any bracket fungus, soft fleshy texture when fresh"	No visible symptoms	No visible symptoms	"Crown thinning in Scots pine especially — slow progressive decline as root rot advances over years"	The cauliflower-like lobed frond structure is COMPLETELY UNIQUE — there is no other common fungus that looks like this at the base of a tree. Cannot be confused with any bracket. Pale cream/yellow multi-lobed mass always at the base of conifers (especially Scots pine). Causes brown cubical rot of roots. Edible when young but never relevant to tree inspection.	"ALL BRACKETS: Sparassis has NO bracket or shelf form whatsoever — entirely different morphology. MERIPILUS: Overlapping fan-shaped brackets (not lobed fronds), broadleaf host. PHAEOLUS: Shelf bracket form, yellow-green margin, conifer but bracket shaped. UNIQUE TO SPARASSIS: Cauliflower/brain-like lobed frond mass — morphologically unique, impossible to confuse if seen, conifer specialist (Scots pine primarily), brown cubical rot."	"Host: Scots pine primarily, occasionally other conifers. Morphology: Unlike any bracket — multi-lobed wavy fronds in a pale cream mass. Size: Large (can exceed 50cm diameter). Annual: Appears late summer/autumn. Texture: Soft fleshy when fresh, becomes tough and dark with age. Rot type: Brown cubical rot of roots and butt. Edibility: Edible when young (culinary value irrelevant to inspection). Name: Crispa = curled/wavy (describes frond form). Risk: Significant — root compromise, windthrow risk."	"CAULIFLOWER or BRAIN-shaped pale cream mass at CONIFER BASE = Sparassis crispa. Only answer possible — morphology is unique. No exam trick, no near-miss — if it looks like a cauliflower at the base of a pine, it is Sparassis. Remember: Sparassis (double-S, one-R), crispa (one-S, one-P — means curled). Easy marks if you learn the shape."	sparassis_cauliflower
22	YES	Trametes versicolor	Turkey Tail	No visible root symptoms — saprophyte on dead wood only	"Thin bracket clusters on dead wood at base, concentric coloured zones (blue-grey, brown, cream, green-blue) in the same bracket — multicoloured pattern diagnostic"	"Thin brackets on dead stubs at stem base or dead lower stem wood, velvet surface on upper side, white circular pores on underside"	"Thin multicoloured brackets on dead branch stubs higher in crown"	"Numerous small thin brackets on dead branch stubs throughout crown — tree otherwise healthy or in normal decline"	"Crown healthy or normally aged — deadwood expected for species and age. No crown decline caused by Trametes."	Thin brackets with MULTIPLE COLOUR ZONES in blue, grey, brown, cream and sometimes green-blue in concentric rings on the SAME bracket — no other common fungus has this multicoloured zoning pattern. Strictly saprophytic — only ever on confirmed dead wood, never on living tissue. Common, widespread, and often alarming to clients who assume it indicates disease. Important for client communication.	"GANODERMA: Brown or grey, thick woody brackets, at base, pathogenic. BJERKANDERA: Smoky-grey pores, thin but single grey-brown tone (not multicoloured). FOMES: Grey hoof-shaped, hard woody, not multicoloured. UNIQUE TO TRAMETES: Multicoloured concentric zones (blue, grey, brown, cream — often in same bracket), thin and flexible (not woody), white circular pore surface, STRICTLY saprophytic on dead wood, very common in healthy trees with natural deadwood."	"Ecology: Strictly saprophytic — colonises dead wood only, never pathogenic. Location: Dead branch stubs, pruning wounds, dead stems. Zones: Multiple colours in concentric rings — same bracket may show blue-grey, brown, cream, green-blue. Texture: Thin, flexible, velvety upper surface. Pores: White, small, circular. Significance: None — indicates deadwood (normal in maturing trees). Client value: Very commonly misidentified as disease — important to communicate it is not a threat. Common name from turkey tail feather resemblance."	"If THIN MULTICOLOURED BRACKETS on dead wood = Trametes versicolor. The multiple colour zones in one bracket are diagnostic — no other common species does this. ALWAYS check it is on DEAD wood — if on living tissue, reconsider. Important for client reassurance: NOT a disease. Remember: Trametes (one-M, one-T), versicolor (versi = varied, color = colour — the name describes it perfectly)."	trametes_multicolour_zones
23	YES	Daedaleopsis confragosa	Blushing Bracket	No visible root symptoms — saprophyte and weak pathogen on dead and dying wood	"Thin to medium brackets on dead or dying wood at base, grey-brown to reddish-brown upper surface with concentric zones, white to pink pore surface underneath"	"Brackets on lower stem, particularly at old wounds — pore surface elongated/maze-like (not circular)"	"Brackets at branch stubs and old wounds higher on stem"	"Brackets on major branches at attachment points and old pruning wounds"	"Crown shows localised dieback above bracket locations on dying branches — not a primary crown pathogen"	The BLUSHING reaction — pore surface turns PINK to RED when rubbed or bruised — is UNIQUE among common brackets. Test in field: rub the white pore surface firmly with a finger; if it blushes pink, it is Daedaleopsis. Maze-like elongated pores (daedaloid — hence the name) on the underside rather than circular. Willow and alder specialist primarily.	"TRAMETES: Multicoloured zones, circular pores, thin, does NOT blush pink. GANODERMA: Hard woody, thick, no blushing. PHELLINUS IGNIARIUS: Grey-black, extremely hard, willow host but no blushing. BJERKANDERA: Smoky-grey pores, thin, no blushing. UNIQUE TO DAEDALEOPSIS: Blushing reaction (pore surface turns pink/red when rubbed — diagnostic test), maze-like elongated pores, willow and alder host, medium thin brackets with zoned brown-red upper surface."	"Host: Willow (Salix) and alder (Alnus) primarily, occasionally other broadleaves. Location: Wounds, dead branches, dying stems. Blushing test: Rub pore surface firmly — pink/red colour develops within seconds (diagnostic field test). Pores: Elongated maze-like (daedaloid) — between circular and slot-like. Ecology: Weak pathogen and saprophyte — accelerates decline of already stressed trees. Upper surface: Zoned, grey-brown to reddish-brown. Name: Daedaleopsis from Daedalus (labyrinth) — refers to maze-like pore pattern."	"RUB THE PORE SURFACE — if it turns PINK = Daedaleopsis confragosa. This is the diagnostic field test and the most memorable feature. Willow or alder host supports the ID. Remember: Daedaleopsis (Daed-al-e-op-sis — five syllables, double-O before psis), confragosa (one-F, one-G). The blush test is the hook — do it in the field, teach it to clients."	daedaleopsis_blushing
