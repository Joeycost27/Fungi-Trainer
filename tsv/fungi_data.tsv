1	YES	Armillaria mellea	Honey Fungus	Extensive white mycelial fans visible under bark at root collar when peeled, firm texture and spreading pattern indicative of active colonisation	Black rhizomorphs (bootlaces) visible in soil radiating from base, 2-4mm diameter, tough and string-like, resistant to tearing	No visible external symptoms on bark surface	No visible external symptoms	No visible symptoms on branches	Progressive crown thinning with reduced vigour, leaves smaller than normal, premature autumn colour - crown symptoms indicate root and vascular compromise from below	The combination of white mycelial fans under bark and black rhizomorphs in soil is strongly indicative of Armillaria. No other common fungus produces bootlace-like rhizomorphs. Crown thinning without lower stem symptoms points to root and vascular compromise. Fruiting bodies are frequently absent when crown symptoms are present.	GANODERMA: Woody brackets at base, no rhizomorphs, brown spore deposits. PSEUDOINONOTUS DRYADEUS: Amber droplets on brackets, no rhizomorphs. MERIPILUS: Large rosette fruiting bodies with brown bruising, no rhizomorphs. DISTINGUISHING ARMILLARIA: Rhizomorphs are confined to this genus among common tree pathogens, white mycelial fans under bark, mushroomy odour when bark peeled, frequently no fruiting bodies when crown symptomatic.	Host range: Broad - most broadleaves and conifers susceptible. Primary infection court: Root system and root collar. Decay type: White rot involving simultaneous degradation of lignin and cellulose, producing pale fibrous residue in structural roots. Structural implication: Progressive reduction in anchorage stability with increased susceptibility to root plate rotation under dynamic wind loading. Spread: Root-to-root contact and rhizomorph extension through soil. Progression: Variable - may cause host death within 2-5 years or persist for decades depending on host vigour and site conditions. Risk level: High - aggressive pathogen capable of spreading through tree populations.	If you see rhizomorphs or bootlaces in an exam question = Armillaria mellea until proven otherwise. No other common fungus has these. If mycelial fans under bark at collar = likely Armillaria, definitive if rhizomorphs also present. Remember double-L in Armillaria and double-L in mellea.	armillaria_fans_rhizomorphs
2	YES	Ganoderma australe	Southern Bracket	Root flare excavation reveals soft fibrous pale residue consistent with white rot, spongy texture, structural roots affected	Large hoof-shaped perennial brackets present at root collar, concentrically zoned brown upper surface, white margin when actively growing, hard woody texture with stratified pore tubes	White pore surface visible on underside of brackets, heavy brown spore deposits accumulating on ground and lower bark	No visible symptoms	No visible symptoms	Crown may appear relatively unaffected despite significant root decay - vascular function maintained until late stage of root loss	Brown spore deposits on ground beneath brackets are strongly indicative of the Ganoderma genus. Hoof-shaped woody brackets with zoned brown upper surface and matte finish distinguish G. australe from related species. Root decay progresses while crown condition is maintained - roots fail before vascular function is compromised.	GANODERMA APPLANATUM: Flat shelf form not hoof-shaped, thinner brackets, grey-brown matte surface without concentric colour zoning. GANODERMA RESINACEUM: Resinous lacquered coating on upper surface - G. australe is matte. MERIPILUS: Rosette form at base with brown bruising reaction. PSEUDOINONOTUS DRYADEUS: Amber droplets, rough bracket surface, rust-brown pores. DISTINGUISHING G. AUSTRALE: Hoof-shaped form, concentrically zoned matte brown surface, hard woody texture, heavy spore deposits, white pore surface - all three features together.	Host association: Predominantly Fagus sylvatica and other broadleaves including Quercus spp. Primary infection court: Structural roots and root collar. Decay type: White rot - simultaneous degradation of lignin and cellulose producing pale fibrous residue with progressive reduction in root cross-sectional strength. Tube stratification: Annual pore layers visible in cross section - useful confirmation. Structural implication: Progressive reduction in anchorage stability leading to root plate rotation under dynamic wind loading, often with minimal prior crown warning. Failure mode: Windthrow most common. Bracket growth: Perennial - new pore layer added annually, bracket mass increases over time.	HOOF-SHAPED matte bracket at base = G. australe. FLAT shelf = G. applanatum. SHINY lacquered surface = G. resinaceum. Heavy brown spore deposits confirm Ganoderma genus. Remember: Ganoderma has two N's, australe has no double letters. Australe means southern - think Australia.	ganoderma_australe_hoof
3	YES	Ganoderma applanatum	Artist's Bracket	Root plate excavation reveals white rot in structural roots, stringy fibrous pale residue, roots reduced in cross-sectional integrity	Large flat shelf-like brackets at base, grey-brown upper surface without concentric colour zoning, overlapping tiers common, very hard woody texture	Brackets extend up lower stem, flat shelf form continues, brown spore deposits accumulate on lower bark below brackets	No visible symptoms	No visible symptoms	Crown may appear relatively healthy despite root compromise - typical Ganoderma pattern of maintained vascular function until late root loss	Flat shelf form distinguishes G. applanatum from hoof-shaped G. australe. Grey-brown matte upper surface without concentric colour zoning is characteristic. White pore surface browns permanently when scratched - the feature giving rise to the common name. Prolific spore production creates heavy deposits. Root decay while crown condition is maintained is the typical Ganoderma presentation.	GANODERMA AUSTRALE: Hoof-shaped not flat, concentrically zoned brown matte surface, heavier bracket mass. GANODERMA RESINACEUM: Resinous lacquered coating - G. applanatum is matte and grey-brown. FOMES FOMENTARIUS: Grey hoof-shaped, predominantly on stem not base, beech association. CERIOPORUS SQUAMOSUS: Scaly cap, cream pores, distinct lateral stalk, wound location. DISTINGUISHING G. APPLANATUM: Flat shelf form, grey-brown matte colour without zoning, white pore surface browns when scratched, heavy spore deposits.	Host association: Wide - Fagus, Quercus, Betula and other broadleaves commonly affected. Primary infection court: Structural roots and root collar, can extend higher on stem than G. australe. Decay type: White rot - simultaneous degradation of lignin and cellulose producing pale fibrous residue. Tube stratification: Annual pore layers visible in section - perennial growth with new tube layer each year. Structural implication: Progressive reduction in root anchorage stability, increased susceptibility to root plate rotation under wind loading. Spore production: Among the highest of any bracket fungus - brown deposits are a reliable indicator of bracket presence.	FLAT shelf = G. applanatum. HOOF-shaped = G. australe. Scratch test - if white pore surface browns permanently when scratched = G. applanatum. Remember: applanatum has double-P and double-N. Both letters doubled - remember that pairing.	ganoderma_applanatum_shelf
4	NO	Pseudoinonotus dryadeus	Weeping Oak Polypore	Root collar shows extensive decay, soft and crumbly when probed, structural roots compromised in excavation	Brackets at root collar, rough irregular surface texture, amber droplets visible on upper surface (weeping appearance), bracket underside pores rust-brown	No brackets typically present on lower stem	No visible symptoms	No visible symptoms	Crown may appear relatively healthy despite severe root collar decay - vascular function maintained until late stage	Amber droplets on bracket surface are strongly indicative of Pseudoinonotus dryadeus - no other common fungus produces this amber exudate. Root collar location is specific. Rust-brown pore surface is characteristic. Causes severe root and collar decay while crown condition is maintained.	GANODERMA: Hoof or shelf form, no amber droplets, white pores, brown spores. MERIPILUS: Rosette form, brown bruising reaction, no droplets. CERIOPORUS SQUAMOSUS: Scaly cap, cream pores, stalk present, no droplets. DISTINGUISHING PSEUDOINONOTUS DRYADEUS: Amber droplets on bracket surface are unique among common species, root collar location, rough irregular bracket form, rust-brown pores, predominantly oak.	Host: Predominantly Quercus spp., occasionally Castanea sativa. Primary infection court: Root collar. Amber exudate: Present on actively growing fresh brackets - may dry and leave staining on older specimens. Decay type: White rot of roots and root collar producing soft fibrous residue. Structural implication: Progressive reduction in anchorage stability with increased risk of root plate rotation under dynamic loading. Taxonomy note: Current accepted name is Pseudoinonotus dryadeus - previously listed as Inonotus dryadeus.	AMBER DROPLETS on bracket at OAK ROOT COLLAR = Pseudoinonotus dryadeus. Droplets are unique among common species - no other produces them. Current accepted name is Pseudoinonotus dryadeus - use this in exam answers. Dryadeus refers to dryads (oak tree spirits). Amber weeping = only one answer.	pseudoinonotus_dryadeus_retired
5	YES	Meripilus giganteus	Giant Polypore	Root plate excavation reveals white rot in structural roots, fibrous pale residue, multiple roots affected	Large rosette of overlapping fan-shaped brackets at root collar, total diameter commonly exceeding 1 metre, cream-brown pore surface on underside	Brackets occasionally extend onto lower stem base	No visible symptoms	No visible symptoms	Crown thinning and reduced vigour may be evident - tree showing stress consistent with significant root loss	Rosette form with overlapping fan-shaped brackets is characteristic. Brown to black bruising reaction when fresh bracket tissue is pressed or damaged is a reliable field separation from Grifola frondosa, which does not bruise. Very large overall size. Annual fruiting with soft bracket texture distinguishes from perennial woody brackets such as Ganoderma.	GANODERMA: Hoof or shelf form not rosette, hard woody perennial brackets, no bruising reaction. PSEUDOINONOTUS DRYADEUS: Smaller individual brackets, amber droplets, no bruising reaction. CERIOPORUS SQUAMOSUS: Individual stalked brackets with scaly cap, no bruising reaction. GRIFOLA FRONDOSA: Grey-brown rosette at oak base - critical separation - Grifola does NOT bruise when rubbed, Meripilus bruises brown to black. DISTINGUISHING MERIPILUS: Rosette form, bruising reaction (brown to black on fresh tissue), very large overall size, annual brackets with soft texture.	Host association: Predominantly Fagus sylvatica, also Quercus spp. and other broadleaves. Primary infection court: Structural roots and root collar. Decay type: White rot - simultaneous degradation of lignin and cellulose producing pale fibrous residue. Structural implication: Progressive reduction in anchorage stability with increased susceptibility to root plate rotation under dynamic wind loading. Fruiting: Annual - appears late summer to autumn, degrades over winter. Previous fruiting remains (fibrous degraded tissue) may persist as evidence of prior infection. Failure mode: Windthrow predominant.	If exam says bruises brown or black when touched = Meripilus giganteus - no other common species does this. Bruising test is the single most reliable field separation from Grifola. Giganteus = giant size. Remember: Meripilus one-R, giganteus one-G. Rosette + bruising = Meripilus.	meripilus_rosette_bruising
6	YES	Kretzschmaria deusta	Brittle Cinder	No visible root symptoms typically - decay is confined to the stem base not the root system	Grey powdery patches on bark at base progressing to hard black crusty stromata at the stem base, bark loose and peeling, tissue beneath dark and brittle when snapped	Black crusty stromata extending up lower stem, can cover a large proportion of stem circumference, bark detaches exposing black brittle tissue beneath	Extension of stromata may reach 2-3m height in advanced cases	No visible symptoms	Crown thinning and dieback in advanced stages, leaves smaller and reduced vigour - crown condition often masks the severity of stem decay until late stage	Grey to black crusty stromata on the STEM combined with brittle ceramic-like fracture of the wood beneath is characteristic of Kretzschmaria deusta. No other common decay fungus produces this fracture type. Crown condition remains deceptively good until very late in decay progression. Primary infection court is the stem base, not the root system - a critical distinction from most other serious pathogens.	ARMILLARIA: White mycelial fans and rhizomorphs, root-based pathogen, wood retains fibrous fracture characteristics. GANODERMA: Bracket fruiting bodies at base, root decay predominant, wood shows fibrous not brittle fracture. BJERKANDERA: Small thin brackets exclusively on dead tissue, saprophytic, no brittle fracture. DISTINGUISHING KRETZSCHMARIA: Grey to black stromata without bracket or rhizomorph form, brittle fracture in wood (snaps cleanly with no fibrous tearing - distinct from all other common pathogens), stem-based primary infection court, sudden failure potential.	Host association: Wide broadleaf range - Fagus, Fraxinus, Tilia, Acer and others commonly affected. Primary infection court: Stem base, commonly at root collar and lower stem - distinct from root pathogens. Decay type: Soft rot - enzymatic degradation of cell wall layers producing characteristic brittle fracture with no fibrous tearing and minimal residual wall thickness. Structural implication: Progressive loss of compressive strength in buttress and lower stem tissues, leading to longitudinal stem fracture under bending or compressive loading with minimal prior warning. Failure mode: Brittle stem fracture - sudden and catastrophic. Crown condition: Maintained until very late stage, making visual assessment unreliable. Danger assessment: Among the highest of common decay fungi due to sudden failure mode and deceptive crown condition. Progression: Relatively rapid once established at stem base.	GREY TO BLACK CRUST on STEM (not brackets, not bootlaces) = Kretzschmaria deusta. BRITTLE fracture of wood beneath confirms it. Most dangerous common fungus for sudden failure. Remember: Kretzschmaria (K-r-e-t-z - unusual spelling), deusta = burnt (black appearance). Grey stage and black stage are the same fungus at different points in development.	kretzschmaria_black_stromata
7	YES	Fomes fomentarius	Tinder Fungus	No visible root symptoms - primary decay is of stem heartwood not roots	Brackets occasionally present at base but more typically found higher on stem	Perennial hoof-shaped brackets, grey upper surface with concentric grooves, very hard woody texture, multiple brackets at various stem heights	Brackets common on upper stem, hoof form continues, concentric groove pattern consistent throughout	Brackets may appear at larger branch unions in advanced cases	Crown thinning progressive as heartwood decay extends through scaffold branch attachment points	Grey hoof-shaped perennial brackets on STEM rather than base is the key distinction from Ganoderma. Concentric grooves on matte grey surface. Predominantly associated with Fagus. White rot of heartwood progresses slowly. Hard woody bracket texture and matte grey colour separate it from brown Ganoderma species.	GANODERMA AUSTRALE: Brown zoned matte surface not grey, base location predominant not stem, heavy brown spore deposits. PHELLINUS IGNIARIUS: Grey-black not grey, willow host, harder texture. CERIOPORUS SQUAMOSUS: Scaly surface, distinct lateral stalk, cream pores, wound location. DISTINGUISHING FOMES: Grey matte colour, hoof form with concentric grooves, predominantly on stem not base, Fagus association, no spore deposits, very slow growing perennial.	Host association: Predominantly Fagus sylvatica, occasionally Betula and other broadleaves. Primary infection court: Stem at old wounds, branch scars and branch attachment points. Decay type: White rot - simultaneous degradation of lignin and cellulose producing pale fibrous residue within heartwood. Structural implication: Progressive reduction in residual wall thickness of heartwood, increasing risk of stem failure at bracket locations and scaffold branch attachment points. Failure mode: Stem fracture or branch failure at areas of decay concentration. Bracket growth: Perennial - new pore layer added annually, bracket becomes very hard with age. Historical use: Bracket tissue used as tinder (amadou) - gives rise to both the common and Latin names.	GREY hoof on BEECH STEM = Fomes fomentarius. BROWN hoof at BASE = Ganoderma. Location is the key separation - stem not base. Remember: Fomes = tinder (fire starting), fomentarius same root. One-M in Fomes. Grey colour plus beech host = reliable combination.	fomes_fomentarius_grey_hoof
8	YES	Inonotus hispidus	Shaggy Bracket	No visible root symptoms - decay is localised to stem and branch tissue at infection points	No brackets typically at base	Brackets on main stem, rough hairy upper surface, rust-brown colour, soft velvety texture when young becoming harder and darker with age	Brackets common on upper stem at old branch stubs or wounds, irregular bracket form	Brackets at branch attachment points on larger scaffold branches	Localised crown dieback above bracket locations, dead branches evident, thinning in affected sectors above decay zones	Rough hairy bracket surface (hispidus = hairy) combined with rust-brown colour and ash association is characteristic. Appears at branch stubs and wounds on stem and branches rather than at the base. Annual brackets. Localised decay at attachment points with branch dieback above affected areas.	FOMES: Grey not rust-brown, smooth not hairy, perennial, predominantly beech, hoof-shaped. CERIOPORUS SQUAMOSUS: Scaly not hairy, cream pores, distinct lateral stalk, larger overall size. PHELLINUS SPP.: Grey-black, not hairy surface texture. DISTINGUISHING INONOTUS HISPIDUS: Hairy to shaggy surface texture (hispidus = hairy), rust-brown colour, predominantly ash, branch and wound locations not base, annual brackets, causes branch dieback above bracket.	Host association: Predominantly Fraxinus excelsior, also Malus, Juglans and Platanus. Primary infection court: Old wounds, branch stubs and pruning cuts on stem and branches. Decay type: White rot - simultaneous degradation of lignin and cellulose producing pale fibrous residue, localised around infection point. Structural implication: Reduction in residual strength of branch attachment zones and stem tissue at bracket locations, increasing risk of branch failure at the decay interface. Failure mode: Branch drop or stem failure at bracket location. Annual: Degrades over winter - absence of fresh bracket does not confirm absence of decay. Progresses within host tissue between fruiting seasons.	Hairy or shaggy brackets on ASH = Inonotus hispidus. Hispidus literally means hairy or bristly - the name tells you the texture. Ash association key. Remember: Inonotus one-N, hispidus one-S at start and one-D. Hairy texture is the field test.	inonotus_hispidus_hairy
9	YES	Perenniporia fraxinea	Ash Bracket	Root collar shows white rot when probed in advanced cases - structural roots affected progressively	Pale buff to cream coloured perennial brackets at base, concentrically grooved surface, relatively hard texture	Brackets occasionally extend to lower stem	No visible symptoms	No visible symptoms	Progressive crown thinning and reduced vigour over several years as root integrity declines	Pale buff to cream coloured perennial brackets predominantly associated with Fraxinus. White rot of roots and butt. Brackets show concentric growth rings confirming perennial growth. Relatively inconspicuous compared to Ganoderma. Commonly found on veteran ash trees. Smaller and paler than Ganoderma species.	GANODERMA: Brown or grey-brown not pale buff, larger bracket mass, heavier spore deposits, wider host range. CERIOPORUS SQUAMOSUS: Scaly cap, cream pores, distinct lateral stalk, annual. TRAMETES VERSICOLOR: Thin leathery brackets, multicoloured zones, dead wood only. DISTINGUISHING PERENNIPORIA: Pale buff to cream colour (notably paler than Ganoderma), Fraxinus association (fraxinea = of ash), perennial growth, white rot of roots, veteran tree association, smaller and less conspicuous than Ganoderma.	Host association: Predominantly Fraxinus excelsior, occasionally other broadleaves. Primary infection court: Structural roots and root collar. Decay type: White rot - simultaneous degradation of lignin and cellulose producing pale fibrous residue with progressive reduction in root cross-sectional integrity. Structural implication: Reduction in anchorage stability with increased susceptibility to root plate rotation under dynamic loading. Progression: Slower than Armillaria but still significant over time. Association: Commonly found on veteran and ancient ash trees - important in veteran tree assessment. Bracket size: Smaller than Ganoderma at 5-15cm typical, easily overlooked.	Pale buff brackets on ASH = likely Perenniporia fraxinea. Fraxinea directly means of ash (Fraxinus) - the name gives you the host. Less well known than Ganoderma but important on veteran ash. Remember: Perenniporia double-N and double-R, fraxinea one-X. Pale colour plus ash host = key combination.	perenniporia_fraxinea_pale
10	YES	Laetiporus sulphureus	Chicken of the Woods	No visible root symptoms - primary decay is of heartwood in stem and branches	Annual brackets may appear at base of stem but more commonly higher	Bright yellow to orange brackets, soft fleshy texture when fresh, bracket edges bright sulphur yellow, overlapping shelf form	Brackets common on main stem, vibrant colour immediately apparent, multiple overlapping tiers possible	Large brackets can appear at major branch unions	Localised crown dieback and dead branches above bracket locations - tree vigour declining in affected scaffold sections	Bright yellow to orange colour is immediately apparent and strongly indicative - no other common bracket fungus produces this colour. Soft fleshy texture when fresh. Causes brown rot with delamination pattern. Annual brackets appear in summer and degrade over winter. Multiple overlapping shelves.	FOMES: Grey not yellow, hoof form, hard texture, perennial. GANODERMA: Brown not yellow, base location, hard woody texture, perennial. CERIOPORUS SQUAMOSUS: Scaly cap, cream pores, distinct lateral stalk. INONOTUS HISPIDUS: Rust-brown not bright yellow, hairy surface. DISTINGUISHING LAETIPORUS: Bright sulphur yellow to orange colour (unique among common brackets), soft fleshy texture when fresh, brown rot with delamination, annual fruiting, sulphureus = sulphur yellow.	Host association: Wide range - Quercus, Castanea, Robinia, Salix and others. Primary infection court: Wounds, branch stubs and included bark zones on stem and branches. Decay type: Brown rot - preferential cellulose depolymerisation leaving cuboid lignin-rich residue with characteristic cubic cracking pattern and delamination along growth rings. Structural implication: Progressive reduction in residual wall thickness and compressive strength of affected stem and branch tissue, increasing risk of failure at bracket locations. Failure mode: Stem fracture or branch failure at zones of advanced decay. Annual: Bracket degrades over winter - presence of orange staining or degraded tissue may indicate prior fruiting.	BRIGHT YELLOW brackets = Laetiporus sulphureus - no other common bracket is this colour. Unmistakable. Remember: Laetiporus one-T, sulphureus (sulphur = yellow - the name is the clue). Annual - appears summer, degrades by autumn.	laetiporus_bright_yellow
11	YES	Fistulina hepatica	Beefsteak Fungus	No visible root symptoms - primary decay is of butt and stem heartwood	Annual brackets at base and lower stem, deep red-brown colour resembling raw meat, soft fleshy texture, exudes red juice when cut	Brackets on lower stem particularly in cavities and at old wounds, bleeding appearance when fresh	Brackets occasionally at greater height on stem	Brackets rare on branches	Crown may appear relatively healthy in early stages - shows reduced vigour and stress symptoms as heartwood decay progresses	Deep red-brown brackets exuding red juice when cut is strongly indicative - no other common bracket fungus bleeds in this way. Soft fleshy tongue-like form. Brown cubical rot progresses slowly. Predominantly associated with sweet chestnut and oak. Cavity colonisation common.	GANODERMA: Brown but hard woody texture, no red juice, white rot not brown rot. LAETIPORUS: Yellow to orange not red-brown, no red juice. INONOTUS HISPIDUS: Rust-brown, hairy surface, no juice, ash host, branch location. DISTINGUISHING FISTULINA: Exudes red juice when cut (unique among common brackets), soft fleshy tongue-like texture, brown cubical rot, predominantly sweet chestnut and oak, cavity colonisation, hepatica = liver-like.	Host association: Predominantly Castanea sativa and Quercus spp. Primary infection court: Butt, stem base and cavities - commonly enters via old wounds and stem damage. Decay type: Brown rot - preferential cellulose depolymerisation leaving cuboid lignin-rich residue. Notably slower progression than most other brown rot fungi. Structural implication: Progressive reduction in compressive strength of buttress and lower stem heartwood - rate of structural compromise is relatively slow. Failure mode: Butt shear or stem failure at zones of advanced decay. Progression: Slow - host trees may survive for decades with established infection. Cavity colonisation: Commonly associated with the formation and enlargement of stem cavities.	If exam mentions bleeding red juice or beefsteak appearance = Fistulina hepatica. No other common bracket bleeds. Hepatica = liver-like (appearance and texture). Sweet chestnut association is strong. Remember: Fistulina one-S, hepatica one-T. Cut it and it bleeds - that is the field test.	fistulina_beefsteak_bleeding
12	YES	Phellinus igniarius	Willow Bracket	No visible root symptoms - primary decay is of stem heartwood	Brackets occasionally at base but more typically higher on stem	Perennial hoof-shaped brackets on stem, grey-black upper surface, extremely hard woody texture, rusty-brown colour when broken internally	Multiple brackets at various stem heights, hard woody texture consistent throughout	Brackets can appear on larger branches	Progressive crown thinning and reduced vigour as heartwood decay extends - willow characteristically produces epicormic growth in response to stress	Grey-black hoof-shaped perennial brackets with extremely hard texture predominantly on Salix. White rot of heartwood. Perennial brackets grow very slowly and add layers annually. Darker colour and harder texture distinguish from Fomes fomentarius. The hardest common bracket fungus.	FOMES FOMENTARIUS: Lighter grey not grey-black, predominantly beech not willow, similar hoof form. GANODERMA: Brown colour, base location predominant, brown spore deposits. INONOTUS HISPIDUS: Rust-brown not grey-black, hairy surface, ash association. DISTINGUISHING PHELLINUS IGNIARIUS: Grey-black colour (darker than Fomes), extremely hard texture (hardest common bracket), predominantly willow, white rot of heartwood, very slow growing perennial, rusty-brown internally when broken.	Host association: Predominantly Salix spp., occasionally Populus. Primary infection court: Stem wounds, branch scars and branch attachment points. Decay type: White rot - simultaneous degradation of lignin and cellulose producing pale fibrous residue within heartwood. Structural implication: Progressive reduction in residual wall thickness of heartwood with increasing risk of stem failure at bracket locations. Failure mode: Stem fracture at zones of advanced heartwood decay. Bracket growth: Perennial and very slow - bracket age may be considerable, indicating long-established infection. Texture: Extremely dense woody - historically used in fire-starting due to hardness and slow combustion.	GREY-BLACK hoof on WILLOW STEM = Phellinus igniarius. Hardest common bracket - try to break a piece off. Igniarius = relating to fire (historical use). Remember: Phellinus double-L, igniarius one-G. Willow host is the key identification filter.	phellinus_igniarius_willow
13	YES	Fomitopsis betulina	Birch Polypore	No visible root symptoms - saprophytic coloniser of dead and dying tissue, not a primary root pathogen	Brackets can appear at base on dead or dying birch - rounded form at various heights on stem	Annual brackets on stem, round to kidney-shaped, pale grey-brown smooth upper surface, white pore surface on underside	Multiple brackets throughout stem length on dead or dying birch - white underside diagnostic	Brackets on branches of dead birch	Crown extensively dead or in terminal decline with significant deadwood - bark peeling in characteristic sheets	Birch specialist (betulina = of birch). Round to kidney-shaped annual brackets with smooth pale upper surface and pure white pore surface. Saprophytic coloniser - present on trees already dying or dead from other causes. Not a primary pathogen. Very host-specific.	FOMES FOMENTARIUS: Grey but hoof-shaped not round, perennial, predominantly beech. TRAMETES VERSICOLOR: Thinner, multicoloured zones, on dead wood of multiple species. GANODERMA: Brown colour, base location, hard woody perennial, different form. DISTINGUISHING FOMITOPSIS BETULINA: Birch association (very specific), round to kidney-shaped form, smooth pale upper surface, white pore surface, saprophytic coloniser not primary pathogen, appears on dead or dying trees, annual brackets.	Host association: Betula spp. exclusively among common associations. Ecology: Saprophytic - colonises dead and dying birch, contributing to decomposition. Not the primary cause of host death. Primary infection court: Not applicable as primary pathogen - enters dead and dying tissue. Decay type: Brown rot - preferential cellulose depolymerisation of dead birch tissue. Structural implication: Accelerates structural degradation of already dead or dying trees - bracket presence indicates advanced host decline. Assessment note: Bracket presence confirms tree is dead or in terminal decline - not an incidental finding. Historical: Used medicinally and as razor strop - hence alternative common name.	BIRCH with ROUND brackets = Fomitopsis betulina. Very host-specific. NOT pathogenic - appears after tree is already dying from other causes. Current accepted name is Fomitopsis betulina - betulina from Betula (birch). White pores underneath are diagnostic. Saprophyte - always note this distinction in reports.	fomitopsis_betulina_birch
14	YES	Fomitopsis pinicola	Red-Belted Bracket	No visible root symptoms - primarily a stem and branch pathogen	Brackets can appear at base but more commonly on stem	Perennial hoof-shaped brackets, distinctive red-brown band at active growing margin, grey-black older surface with resinous appearance	Brackets common on main stem of conifers, red margin diagnostic feature consistent throughout	Brackets on dead branches and stubs	Crown shows progressive deadwood development in lower sections - epicormic growth below live crown on affected pines	Red-brown margin at the actively growing bracket edge is characteristic and separates Fomitopsis pinicola from other common conifer brackets. Perennial hoof-shaped brackets on conifers. Grey-black older surface contrasting with the red-brown active margin. Resinous appearance. Brown rot.	GANODERMA RESINACEUM: Brown with resinous lacquered surface, no red margin, predominantly broadleaf. FOMES FOMENTARIUS: Grey throughout with no red margin, predominantly beech. PHELLINUS IGNIARIUS: Grey-black throughout with no red margin, willow host. DISTINGUISHING FOMITOPSIS PINICOLA: Red-brown margin at actively growing edge (unique among common conifer brackets), conifer specialist, brown rot, resinous appearance, grey-black older surface contrasting with red margin.	Host association: Predominantly conifers - Pinus, Picea, Abies and Larix. Occasionally recorded on broadleaves. Primary infection court: Stem wounds, branch scars and dead branch stubs. Decay type: Brown rot - preferential cellulose depolymerisation leaving cuboid lignin-rich residue with characteristic cubic cracking. Structural implication: Progressive reduction in compressive strength of stem heartwood with increasing risk of stem fracture at zones of advanced decay. Failure mode: Stem fracture at areas of concentrated decay. Brackets: Perennial - new growth adds red-brown margin annually over grey-black older tissue. Resinous appearance distinctive.	RED MARGIN on bracket on CONIFERS = Fomitopsis pinicola. The red margin is diagnostic and unlike any other common conifer bracket. Pinicola = living on pine (conifer host). Remember: Fomitopsis one-M and one-T, pinicola one-N and one-C. Red-belted common name directly describes the margin.	fomitopsis_red_margin
15	YES	Bjerkandera adusta	Smoky Bracket	No visible root symptoms - strictly saprophytic, not a root pathogen	Small thin brackets on confirmed dead branch stubs in lower crown, pale grey upper surface, smoky-grey pore surface underneath	Small brackets on dead stub ends on main stem, thin leathery texture throughout	Small brackets on confirmed dead stubs at pruning cuts higher up	Numerous small thin brackets on dead branch stubs throughout crown - tree otherwise in normal condition for age and species	Crown overall healthy and normal for species and age - presence of dead stubs is normal in maturing trees and not indicative of decline	Small thin leathery brackets exclusively on confirmed dead tissue. Smoky-grey pore surface (adusta = scorched or smoky). Strictly saprophytic - colonises dead tissue only and is not associated with pathogenic activity. Normal finding in trees with natural deadwood. Reliably separated from pathogens by restriction to confirmed dead tissue.	GANODERMA: Large woody brackets at base on living tissue, pathogenic. FOMES: Larger hoof-shaped, on living heartwood. CERIOPORUS SQUAMOSUS: Larger, distinct lateral stalk, scaly cap. ARMILLARIA: Mycelial fans and rhizomorphs, pathogenic, on living tissue. DISTINGUISHING BJERKANDERA: Small thin leathery brackets exclusively on dead tissue (never on living wood), smoky-grey pore surface, strictly saprophytic, normal presence in healthy maturing trees.	Ecology: Strictly saprophytic - colonises confirmed dead tissue only, with no pathogenic activity recorded. Primary substrate: Dead branch stubs, pruning wounds, dead stems and twigs. Colour: Pale grey upper surface, smoky-grey pore surface (adusta = scorched). Form: Small (2-5cm typical), thin and leathery. Structural implication: None - presence indicates natural deadwood accumulation appropriate to tree age and species. Not associated with decay of living tissue. Assessment note: Commonly mistaken for pathogenic brackets by non-specialists - correct identification has significant implications for tree management recommendations. Important for accurate client communication.	If brackets are ONLY on confirmed dead stubs with no living wood invasion = Bjerkandera adusta (saprophyte). If on living wood = reconsider. Smoky-grey pores are diagnostic. Important for client communication - NOT a disease. Remember: Bjerkandera unusual spelling one-R, adusta one-D. Saprophyte vs pathogen is the critical distinction here.	bjerkandera_deadwood_saprophyte
16	YES	Ganoderma resinaceum	Resinous Bracket	Root flare excavation reveals white rot in structural roots - soft fibrous pale residue, anchorage integrity reduced	Large brackets at base, brown upper surface with distinctive resinous lacquered coating giving a shiny varnished appearance, hard woody texture	Brackets occasionally on lower stem, resinous lacquered coating consistent	No visible symptoms	No visible symptoms	Crown may appear relatively healthy despite significant root compromise - typical of Ganoderma pattern with maintained vascular function until late root loss	Resinous lacquered coating on the upper bracket surface is characteristic and distinguishes G. resinaceum from matte-surfaced Ganoderma species. Brown bracket colour. Hard woody perennial. Root and butt rot with maintained crown condition. Predominantly oak and beech.	GANODERMA AUSTRALE: No resinous coating - matte surface, hoof-shaped. G. australe surface feels rough and matte where G. resinaceum feels lacquered. GANODERMA APPLANATUM: Flat shelf form, grey-brown matte surface, no resinous coating. FOMITOPSIS PINICOLA: Red margin, conifer host, brown rot. DISTINGUISHING G. RESINACEUM: Resinous lacquered coating (shiny, varnished feel - diagnostic versus other Ganoderma), brown colour, perennial, white rot, predominantly oak and beech.	Host association: Predominantly Quercus spp. and Fagus sylvatica. Primary infection court: Structural roots and root collar. Decay type: White rot - simultaneous degradation of lignin and cellulose producing pale fibrous residue with progressive reduction in root structural integrity. Tube stratification: Annual pore layers visible in cross section. Structural implication: Progressive reduction in anchorage stability with increased susceptibility to root plate rotation under dynamic wind loading. Failure mode: Windthrow predominant. Bracket surface: Resinous lacquered coating is the key separation from other Ganoderma - feel the surface. Less commonly recorded than G. australe and G. applanatum.	SHINY RESINOUS coating on Ganoderma bracket = G. resinaceum. Matte surface = G. australe or G. applanatum. Feel the surface - it should feel lacquered or varnished. Remember: resinaceum one-S and one-C. Resinous in the name describes the diagnostic feature directly.	ganoderma_resinaceum_shiny
17	YES	Cerioporus squamosus	Dryad's Saddle	No visible root symptoms - primarily a wound and stem pathogen not a root pathogen	Large brackets at base, distinctive brown scales on cream background on cap surface, cream to pale yellow pore surface on underside, bracket attached by distinct lateral stalk	Brackets on lower stem at old wounds, cavities and branch scars - scaly cap pattern and lateral stalk consistent	Brackets on upper stem at branch stubs and old wounds	Large brackets at major branch unions	Crown shows localised dieback above bracket locations - reduced vigour in affected sectors	Large cream-coloured brackets with brown scales on cap surface (squamosus = scaly) combined with a distinct lateral stalk is strongly indicative - no other common bracket has this combination. Cream to yellow pore surface. Annual brackets in late spring and early summer. Strong mealy odour. White rot at wound locations.	FOMES: Grey hoof-shaped, no scales, no lateral stalk, perennial, base location. GANODERMA: Brown or grey, no scales, no lateral stalk, base location, perennial. LAETIPORUS: Yellow to orange, no scales, no lateral stalk. DISTINGUISHING CERIOPORUS SQUAMOSUS: Scaly cap (brown scales on cream background), distinct lateral stalk (no other common bracket has this), cream to yellow pores, large size, mealy odour, annual, wound and stem location not base.	Host association: Wide broadleaf range - Fraxinus, Ulmus, Acer, Quercus and others. Primary infection court: Old wounds, branch scars, cavities and pruning cuts on stem and major branches. Decay type: White rot - simultaneous degradation of lignin and cellulose at wound sites, producing pale fibrous residue. Structural implication: Reduction in residual strength of stem and branch tissue at wound locations, increasing risk of failure at bracket sites. Failure mode: Stem or branch failure at zones of concentrated decay. Annual: Bracket degrades by autumn - presence of pale discoloured areas on stem may indicate prior fruiting. Odour: Strong mealy to watermelon rind smell - useful field confirmation. Taxonomy: Current accepted name is Cerioporus squamosus, previously Polyporus squamosus.	SCALY CAP and SHORT LATERAL STALK = Cerioporus squamosus - only common bracket with this combination. Cream pores and mealy smell support the ID. Current accepted name is Cerioporus squamosus. Remember: squamosus one-M (scaly - the name describes the most obvious feature). Annual - appears late spring, grows fast, degrades by autumn.	cerioporus_squamosus_scaly
18	YES	Phellinus robustus	Robust Bracket	No visible root symptoms - primary decay is of heartwood at butt and lower stem	Large perennial brackets at base and lower stem, grey-brown to rusty-brown rough upper surface, extremely hard woody texture, rusty-orange at actively growing margin	Brackets occasionally extend up lower stem	No visible symptoms	No visible symptoms	Crown thinning and reduced vigour in advanced stages as heartwood decay progresses	Large rough-surfaced perennial brackets predominantly on oak with extremely hard texture and rusty-orange growing margin. White rot of heartwood at base and lower stem. Distinguished from Ganoderma by rough surface texture, rusty tones and extreme hardness. Less commonly recorded than Ganoderma but significant on mature oak.	GANODERMA: Smooth matte surface not rough, brown or grey-brown zoned or flat form, base location. PHELLINUS IGNIARIUS: Grey-black, predominantly willow not oak, stem location. INONOTUS HISPIDUS: Hairy surface, rust-brown, ash association, annual, branch and wound location. DISTINGUISHING PHELLINUS ROBUSTUS: Rough surface texture (not smooth like Ganoderma), rusty-orange actively growing margin, predominantly oak, extremely hard texture, perennial, white rot of butt and lower stem.	Host association: Predominantly Quercus spp., occasionally other broadleaves. Primary infection court: Stem base and lower stem, commonly associated with old wounds and stem damage. Decay type: White rot - simultaneous degradation of lignin and cellulose producing pale fibrous residue in heartwood. Structural implication: Progressive reduction in residual wall thickness and compressive strength of buttress and lower stem heartwood, increasing risk of stem failure under bending and compressive loads. Failure mode: Stem failure at zones of advanced heartwood decay. Bracket characteristics: Perennial, slow growing, extremely hard - among the hardest brackets recorded. Robustus = robust or strong, referring to bracket size and hardness.	ROUGH RUSTY brackets on OAK base = Phellinus robustus. Rusty-orange growing margin and extreme hardness are the key features. Remember: Phellinus double-L, robustus one-B. Less common than Ganoderma on oak but distinctive once known. Rough texture plus rusty tones plus oak host = the combination.	phellinus_robustus_oak
19	YES	Heterobasidion annosum	Root Rot and Butt Rot	White mycelial mat visible under bark at root collar of conifers when lifted, resinous odour, resin-soaked soil around base	Irregular shelf-like to crust-like fruiting body at base of conifer, pale cream to white pore surface on underside, brown-grey irregular upper surface, hard woody texture	White resinous decay visible in basal wood when probed - external bark may show no obvious symptoms	No visible symptoms	No visible symptoms	Crown thinning and yellowing with needle drop in Scots pine - progressive decline from below while upper crown remains partially active	White to cream pore surface on an irregular shelf or crust at the BASE OF CONIFERS is strongly indicative of Heterobasidion annosum. Absence of rhizomorphs separates from Armillaria. Resinous odour and resin-soaked soil at base are supporting observations. Most economically significant forest pathogen in Europe.	ARMILLARIA MELLEA: Rhizomorphs present, white mycelial fans, affects broadleaves and conifers - no rhizomorphs in Heterobasidion. PHAEOLUS SCHWEINITZII: Yellow-green active margin, annual fruiting, spongy texture. SPARASSIS CRISPA: Cauliflower-like lobed frond form, no shelf bracket. DISTINGUISHING HETEROBASIDION: White to cream irregular pore surface at conifer base, no rhizomorphs, resinous odour and soaking diagnostic, conifer specialist, spread via both root contact and airborne spore colonisation of fresh stumps.	Host association: Predominantly conifers - Pinus sylvestris, Picea abies, Pseudotsuga menziesii and Larix spp. Spread: Dual pathway - root-to-root contact and airborne spore colonisation of fresh-cut stumps. Stump treatment with urea or biological agents is mandatory after felling in infected stands in many forestry contexts. Decay type: White rot - simultaneous degradation of lignin and cellulose in butt and root tissue. Structural implication: Progressive reduction in anchorage stability and butt integrity, with risk of root plate rotation and butt shear under dynamic loading. Detection: Often no external crown symptoms until decay is advanced - makes detection during routine inspection unreliable. Risk: Catastrophic in plantation settings - can affect entire stands.	WHITE irregular bracket or crust at CONIFER BASE = Heterobasidion annosum until proven otherwise. No rhizomorphs separates it from Armillaria - that is the primary field separation. Conifer host is the first filter. Remember: Heterobasidion - Het-er-o-bas-id-i-on - seven syllables. Annosum has double-N: a-nn-o-sum. Stump treatment context may appear in exam questions.	heterobasidion_white_crust
20	YES	Phaeolus schweinitzii	Dyer's Mazegill	Root plate reveals brown cubical rot when probed - wood fractures in cube-like blocks with characteristic cubic cracking, structural roots compromised	Large annual bracket at base, velvety surface, yellow-green to rust-brown colouring with distinctive yellow-green actively growing outer margin, spongy and soft when fresh	Bracket can extend onto lower stem, yellow-green margin visible, degrades rapidly - fibrous rust-brown remains from previous years may be present near base	No visible symptoms	No visible symptoms	Progressive crown thinning and reduced vigour, needle drop in conifers, deadwood developing in lower crown - tree declining from root compromise upward	The yellow-green actively growing margin on a large spongy annual bracket at the base of CONIFERS is strongly indicative - no other common bracket fungus produces this colour margin. Soft spongy texture when fresh is a reliable field test. Causes brown cubical rot. Fibrous rust-brown remains from previous seasons may persist near base as supporting evidence.	MERIPILUS GIGANTEUS: Rosette of overlapping brackets, bruises brown to black, broadleaf host not conifer, no yellow-green margin. SPARASSIS CRISPA: Cauliflower-like lobed frond form, no shelf bracket, no yellow-green. HETEROBASIDION ANNOSUM: White to cream pore surface, hard woody, no yellow-green margin. DISTINGUISHING PHAEOLUS: Yellow-green active margin (unique among common brackets), conifer specialist, spongy annual bracket, brown cubical rot, degrades to fibrous rust-brown remains.	Host association: Predominantly conifers - Pinus sylvestris, Larix spp., Pseudotsuga menziesii and Picea spp. Primary infection court: Structural roots and root collar. Decay type: Brown rot - preferential cellulose depolymerisation leaving cuboid lignin-rich residue with characteristic cubic cracking along and across the grain. Structural implication: Progressive reduction in anchorage stability and root cross-sectional integrity, with increased risk of root plate rotation under dynamic loading. Failure mode: Windthrow predominant. Annual fruiting: Bracket appears late summer to autumn, degrades over winter. Previous season remains (fibrous rust-brown tissue) often visible near base. Colour progression: Yellow-green when actively growing, progressing to rust-brown with age.	YELLOW-GREEN MARGIN on spongy bracket at CONIFER BASE = Phaeolus schweinitzii. Press test - if soft and spongy on a conifer it is very likely Phaeolus. Yellow-green is the unmistakable feature. Remember: Phaeolus - Ph-ae-ol-us, schweinitzii has double-I at end (Schweinitz-ii). Named after mycologist Lewis David de Schweinitz.	phaeolus_yellow_green
21	YES	Sparassis crispa	Cauliflower Fungus	Root plate reveals brown cubical rot - wood fractures along and across grain producing cuboid blocks, structural roots progressively compromised	Large annual fruiting body at base - pale cream to yellow, multi-lobed wavy fronds forming a cauliflower or brain-like mass, base attached to roots or root collar, no bracket or shelf form	Lobed frond mass can reach 50cm in diameter, entirely unlike any bracket fungus, soft fleshy texture when fresh	No visible symptoms	No visible symptoms	Progressive crown thinning and reduced vigour in Scots pine particularly - slow decline as root integrity is lost over successive seasons	The cauliflower-like lobed frond structure is morphologically unique among common tree-associated fungi - no other species produces this form at the base of a tree. Pale cream to yellow multi-lobed mass always at the base of conifers. Causes brown cubical rot of roots. Cannot be confused with any bracket fungus.	ALL BRACKET FUNGI: Sparassis has no bracket or shelf form - entirely different morphology. MERIPILUS GIGANTEUS: Overlapping fan-shaped brackets not lobed fronds, broadleaf host. PHAEOLUS SCHWEINITZII: Shelf bracket form with yellow-green margin, conifer but bracket-shaped not frond. DISTINGUISHING SPARASSIS: Cauliflower or brain-like lobed frond mass (morphologically unique - impossible to confuse if seen), conifer specialist with Scots pine predominant, brown cubical rot, pale cream colour.	Host association: Predominantly Pinus sylvestris, occasionally other conifers. Primary infection court: Structural roots and root collar - commonly enters via root damage or natural infection pathways. Decay type: Brown rot - preferential cellulose depolymerisation leaving cuboid lignin-rich residue with cubic cracking. Structural implication: Progressive reduction in root anchorage integrity with increased susceptibility to root plate rotation under dynamic loading. Failure mode: Windthrow predominant. Annual fruiting: Appears late summer to autumn, soft when fresh, becomes tough and darkens with age. Name: Crispa = curled or wavy, describing the frond form. Edibility: Edible when young - not relevant to assessment context.	CAULIFLOWER or BRAIN-shaped pale cream mass at CONIFER BASE = Sparassis crispa. Only possible answer - morphology is unique. If it looks like a cauliflower at the base of a pine it is Sparassis. No other common fungus looks like this. Remember: Sparassis double-S and one-R, crispa one-S and one-P (means curled). Easy marks if you learn the shape.	sparassis_cauliflower
22	YES	Trametes versicolor	Turkey Tail	No visible root symptoms - strictly saprophytic on dead tissue only	Thin bracket clusters on confirmed dead wood at base, concentric coloured zones of blue-grey, brown, cream and green-blue in the same bracket - multicoloured pattern characteristic	Thin brackets on confirmed dead stubs at stem base, velvet surface on upper side, white small circular pores on underside	Thin multicoloured brackets on confirmed dead branch stubs throughout crown	Numerous small thin brackets on dead branch stubs throughout crown - host tree otherwise in normal condition	Crown healthy and normal for species and age - presence of dead stubs with Trametes is not associated with crown decline	Thin flexible brackets with multiple colour zones in blue, grey, brown, cream and sometimes green-blue in concentric rings on the same bracket. No other common fungus produces this multicoloured zoning pattern. Strictly saprophytic - exclusively on confirmed dead tissue. Common and widespread. Frequently causes concern among clients who mistake it for a pathogenic finding.	GANODERMA: Brown or grey, thick woody brackets, at base on living tissue, pathogenic. BJERKANDERA ADUSTA: Smoky-grey pores, thin brackets but uniform grey-brown colour not multicoloured, dead wood only. FOMES FOMENTARIUS: Grey hoof-shaped, hard woody perennial, not multicoloured. DISTINGUISHING TRAMETES: Multicoloured concentric zones (blue, grey, brown, cream - multiple colours in same bracket), thin flexible not woody texture, small circular white pores, exclusively on confirmed dead wood.	Ecology: Strictly saprophytic - colonises confirmed dead wood only, with no pathogenic activity. Primary substrate: Dead branch stubs, pruning wounds, dead stems - any confirmed dead tissue. Colour zoning: Multiple colours in concentric rings - individual bracket may show blue-grey, brown, cream and green-blue zones. Texture: Thin, flexible, velvety upper surface - not woody. Structural implication: None for living tissue. Assessment note: Very commonly misidentified as a pathogenic fungus - correct identification has significant implications for tree management advice. Client communication: Presence is not associated with decline or failure risk - indicates normal deadwood colonisation appropriate to tree age and species.	THIN MULTICOLOURED BRACKETS on dead wood = Trametes versicolor. Multiple colour zones in one bracket - no other common species does this. Always confirm brackets are on dead tissue. Critical for client communication - NOT a disease. Remember: Trametes one-M and one-T, versicolor (versi = varied, color = colour - the name describes it directly).	trametes_multicolour_zones
23	YES	Daedaleopsis confragosa	Blushing Bracket	No visible root symptoms - primarily a weak pathogen and saprophyte of dying and dead tissue	Thin to medium brackets on dying or dead wood at base, grey-brown to reddish-brown upper surface with concentric zones, white to pale pink pore surface underneath	Brackets on lower stem at old wounds - pore surface elongated and maze-like not circular	Brackets at branch stubs and old wounds higher on stem	Brackets on major branches at attachment points and old pruning wounds	Localised crown dieback above bracket locations on dying branches - not a primary crown pathogen	The blushing reaction - pore surface turns pink to red when rubbed or pressed - is unique among common bracket fungi. This is a reliable field test: rub the white pore surface firmly and observe colour change within seconds. Maze-like elongated pores (daedaloid) on the underside distinguish from Trametes versicolor. Predominantly associated with Salix and Alnus.	TRAMETES VERSICOLOR: Multicoloured concentric zones, small circular pores, thin flexible texture, does not blush when rubbed. GANODERMA: Hard woody thick brackets, no blushing reaction. PHELLINUS IGNIARIUS: Grey-black, extremely hard, Salix host but no blushing reaction. BJERKANDERA ADUSTA: Smoky-grey pores, thin, no blushing reaction. DISTINGUISHING DAEDALEOPSIS: Blushing reaction (pore surface turns pink to red when rubbed - unique among common species), maze-like elongated pores, predominantly Salix and Alnus, medium thin brackets with zoned brown to red upper surface.	Host association: Predominantly Salix spp. and Alnus spp., occasionally other broadleaves. Primary substrate: Old wounds, dying and dead branches and stems. Ecology: Weak pathogen and saprophyte - accelerates decline of already stressed tissue, not a primary cause of decline. Blushing test: Rub pore surface firmly - pink to red colour develops within seconds and is reliable for field identification. Pore form: Elongated maze-like (daedaloid) - intermediate between circular and slotted. Structural implication: Contributes to decay at existing wound sites - not associated with primary structural failure. Assessment note: Presence on dying tissue is normal in stressed or declining Salix and Alnus.	RUB THE PORE SURFACE - if it turns pink = Daedaleopsis confragosa. This is the diagnostic field test and the most memorable feature. Salix or Alnus host supports the ID. Remember: Daedaleopsis - Daed-al-e-op-sis - five syllables, double-O before psis. Confragosa one-F and one-G. The blush test is the hook - do it in the field every time.	daedaleopsis_blushing
24	YES	Grifola frondosa	Hen of the Woods	Root plate reveals white rot in structural roots - fibrous pale residue, roots soft and compromised when probed	Large rosette of overlapping grey-brown fan-shaped brackets at root collar, individual brackets wavy-edged, total rosette commonly reaching 50-80cm in diameter	Brackets occasionally extend onto lower stem base	No visible symptoms	No visible symptoms	Progressive crown thinning and reduced vigour as root compromise develops - tree declining from below	Large rosette of overlapping grey-brown fan-shaped brackets at the base of OAK is characteristic. Visually similar to Meripilus giganteus but reliably separated by the bruising test - Grifola does NOT bruise when rubbed or pressed. Grey-brown upper surface (not cream-brown as in Meripilus). Predominantly oak. Annual brackets.	MERIPILUS GIGANTEUS: Cream-brown brackets, bruises brown to black when pressed (the single most reliable field separation), wider broadleaf host range. GANODERMA: Hard woody hoof or shelf bracket not rosette form, perennial, heavy spore deposits. PHAEOLUS SCHWEINITZII: Yellow-green margin, conifer host, spongy texture. DISTINGUISHING GRIFOLA: Grey-brown overlapping fan rosette, does NOT bruise when rubbed (unlike Meripilus), predominantly oak, white rot, annual, wavy and irregular bracket edges.	Host association: Predominantly Quercus spp., occasionally other broadleaves. Primary infection court: Structural roots and root collar. Decay type: White rot - simultaneous degradation of lignin and cellulose producing pale fibrous residue with progressive reduction in root structural integrity. Bruising test: No colour change when bracket tissue is rubbed or pressed - this separates Grifola from Meripilus with high reliability. Structural implication: Progressive reduction in anchorage stability with increased susceptibility to root plate rotation under dynamic wind loading. Failure mode: Windthrow predominant. Annual fruiting: Appears late summer to autumn.	GREY-BROWN ROSETTE at OAK BASE - rub it. If NO bruising = Grifola frondosa. If bruises BLACK = Meripilus giganteus. The bruise test is the single most important field separation between these two species. Remember: Grifola one-R and one-F, frondosa (frond-like - describes the overlapping bracket form). Oak host plus no bruising = Grifola.	grifola_grey_rosette
25	YES	Phellinus pomaceus	Cushion Bracket	No visible root symptoms - primary infection court is wounds and pruning cuts on stem and branches	Hard perennial brackets on stem or at base of Rosaceae hosts, grey-brown to rust-brown rough upper surface, very hard woody texture, irregular cushion to hoof form	Brackets at old pruning wounds and canker sites on lower stem, extremely hard woody texture, rust-brown when broken internally	Brackets common on upper stem and major scaffold branches at old wounds and pruning cuts	Brackets at branch attachment points and old pruning scars - localised dieback above bracket locations	Localised crown dieback in sectors above bracket locations - progressive loss of scaffold branch function, localised decline not whole-crown failure	Hard perennial brackets specifically on Rosaceae hosts (apple, hawthorn, cherry, plum) is the key observation. Pomaceus = of the apple - the host family is the diagnostic context. Same hard bracket form as other Phellinus species but the Rosaceae host is unique among common brackets. White rot of heartwood at wound and pruning sites.	PHELLINUS IGNIARIUS: Grey-black, predominantly Salix and Populus not Rosaceae. PHELLINUS PINI: Conifer host, entirely different context. GANODERMA: Brown, root and base location, not wound-associated. INONOTUS HISPIDUS: Hairy surface, Fraxinus host, annual. DISTINGUISHING PHELLINUS POMACEUS: Rosaceae host (Malus, Crataegus, Prunus, Pyrus) is strongly indicative - no other common Phellinus is predominantly associated with these hosts, bracket at wounds and pruning cuts, hard perennial cushion form, white rot.	Host association: Rosaceae - predominantly Malus spp., Crataegus spp., Prunus spp. (cherry and plum) and Pyrus spp. Primary infection court: Old wounds, pruning cuts and canker sites on stem and scaffold branches. Decay type: White rot - simultaneous degradation of lignin and cellulose at wound sites producing pale fibrous residue. Structural implication: Progressive reduction in residual strength at wound and pruning sites - increasing risk of branch failure at affected attachment points. Failure mode: Branch failure at zones of concentrated decay. Significance: Common on orchard and hedgerow trees, particularly veteran Crataegus. Pomaceus = of the pome fruits (apple family).	HARD BRACKET on APPLE, HAWTHORN or PLUM = Phellinus pomaceus. The Rosaceae host is the single most reliable observation - no other common Phellinus is predominantly associated with these hosts. Three Phellinus on the exam list: igniarius (willow), pomaceus (apple and hawthorn), pini (pine) - host is the primary identification filter for this genus. Remember: Phellinus double-L, pomaceus one-M and one-C.	phellinus_pomaceus_rosaceae
26	YES	Phellinus pini	Pine Bracket	No visible root symptoms - primary decay is of stem heartwood, not root system	Brackets occasionally at base of pine, grey-black to rust-brown irregular hoof or cushion form, very hard woody texture, rust-brown internally when broken	Brackets on lower stem at resin pockets and old wounds, resin exudate may be present around bracket base	Brackets common on upper stem - heartwood decay extends as a column through stem, resin flow on bark near brackets is a supporting observation	Brackets at branch scars and attachment points in upper crown, multiple brackets at different stem heights on the same tree	Progressive crown thinning and deadwood development - resin flow on stem near brackets supports the identification	Hard perennial brackets at multiple heights on PINE stem combined with resin flow on bark near brackets is characteristic. Causes a column of heartwood decay extending upward through the stem - unlike butt rot pathogens, decay is not confined to the base. Pine specialist. Multiple brackets at various stem heights on the same tree is a reliable observation.	PHELLINUS IGNIARIUS: Grey-black, predominantly Salix not conifer. PHELLINUS POMACEUS: Rosaceae host, not conifer. FOMITOPSIS PINICOLA: Red-brown margin, conifer but brown rot and different bracket form. HETEROBASIDION ANNOSUM: White to cream pore surface at base, root rot not heartwood column. DISTINGUISHING PHELLINUS PINI: Pine specialist, heartwood column decay (not butt or root), multiple brackets at various heights on same stem, resin exudate at bracket sites.	Host association: Predominantly Pinus spp. - Pinus sylvestris most commonly in UK and Ireland. Primary infection court: Stem wounds, branch scars and resin pockets at various stem heights. Decay type: White rot - simultaneous degradation of lignin and cellulose producing pale fibrous residue extending as a column through stem heartwood. Structural implication: Progressive reduction in residual wall thickness throughout the stem column - failure risk is distributed along the height of the stem not concentrated at the base. Failure mode: Longitudinal stem fracture under bending or compressive loading at zones of advanced decay - can occur at any height on the stem. Resin exudate: Exudate around bracket base is a useful supporting observation on Pinus hosts.	MULTIPLE HARD BRACKETS at VARIOUS HEIGHTS on PINE STEM = Phellinus pini. Resin flow near brackets supports the ID. Three Phellinus on the exam list - host separates them every time: igniarius (willow), pomaceus (apple and hawthorn), pini (pine). Remember: Phellinus double-L, pini simply means pine in Latin. Heartwood column decay means failure risk is distributed along the whole stem.	phellinus_pini_stem
27	YES	Pholiota squarrosa	Shaggy Scalycap	Roots show early white rot decay at collar in advanced cases - soft fibrous pale residue when probed	Clusters of mushrooms at base or emerging from buried roots - tawny yellow-brown cap covered in distinctive upturned dry scales, ring present on stem, pronounced garlicky odour	Mushroom clusters emerging from bark fissures or wounds on lower stem - same scaly cap pattern consistent throughout	Clusters can emerge from wounds and fissures higher on stem	Clusters of scaly mushrooms occasionally at major branch unions or wounds	Crown shows reduced vigour and stress symptoms in advanced cases - thinning and localised dieback above heavily infected stem areas	Clustered mushrooms (not brackets) with upturned dry scales covering a tawny-yellow cap is morphologically distinctive among common tree pathogens. No bracket fungus produces this form. Dry recurved scales on cap and stem are reliable field features. Pronounced garlicky odour. White rot of heartwood and roots. Mushroom form rather than bracket is an important distinction for inspection reports.	ARMILLARIA MELLEA: Mushroom form but smooth honey-brown cap with white mycelial fans and rhizomorphs - no dry upturned scales. HYPHOLOMA SPP.: Yellow-green clustered mushrooms without scales. ALL BRACKET FUNGI: Pholiota has no bracket form. DISTINGUISHING PHOLIOTA SQUARROSA: Dry upturned scales covering cap and stem (squarrosa = rough with scales), tawny-yellow colour, clustered habit, garlicky odour - combination unique among common tree-associated pathogens.	Host association: Wide range - Quercus, Fagus, Betula, Malus and others. Primary infection court: Root collar, stem base and wounds. Decay type: White rot - simultaneous degradation of lignin and cellulose at root collar and heartwood. Structural implication: Progressive reduction in residual strength at root collar and lower stem - reduction in anchorage stability and compressive strength of basal tissue. Fruiting form: Mushroom not bracket - clusters arising from root collar, stem base or wounds. Note clearly in inspection reports. Odour: Pronounced garlicky odour is a reliable supporting field observation. Cap: Tawny yellow-brown, densely covered in dry upturned recurved scales. Stem: Also scaly below ring.	DRY UPTURNED SCALES on tawny-yellow CLUSTERED MUSHROOMS at tree base = Pholiota squarrosa. No bracket fungus looks like this - the scaling pattern is unique. Garlicky odour confirms in the field. Mushroom form not bracket - always note this clearly in inspection reports. Remember: Pholiota Ph-ol-i-ota, squarrosa double-R and double-S (describes the rough scaly surface).	pholiota_squarrosa_scaly
28	YES	Pseudoinonotus dryadeus	Weeping Oak Polypore	Root collar shows extensive decay - soft crumbly pale residue when probed, structural roots compromised in excavation	Brackets at root collar - rough irregular upper surface, amber droplets visible on upper bracket surface (weeping appearance), bracket underside pores rust-brown, soft when fresh hardening with age	No brackets typically present on lower stem	No visible symptoms	No visible symptoms	Crown may appear relatively healthy despite severe root collar decay - vascular function maintained until late stage of root loss	Amber droplets on the bracket surface are strongly indicative of Pseudoinonotus dryadeus - no other common fungus produces amber exudate of this type. Root collar location is specific. Rust-brown pore surface is characteristic. Causes severe root and collar decay while crown condition is maintained. Current accepted name is Pseudoinonotus dryadeus.	GANODERMA: Hoof or shelf form, no amber droplets, white pore surface, brown spore deposits. MERIPILUS GIGANTEUS: Rosette form, bruising reaction, no amber droplets. GRIFOLA FRONDOSA: Grey-brown rosette at oak base, no amber droplets. DISTINGUISHING PSEUDOINONOTUS: Amber droplets on bracket surface (unique among common species), root collar location, rough irregular bracket form, rust-brown pore surface, predominantly oak association.	Host association: Predominantly Quercus spp., occasionally Castanea sativa. Primary infection court: Root collar. Amber exudate: Present on actively growing fresh brackets - may dry and leave amber staining on older specimens, which is also supporting evidence. Decay type: White rot - simultaneous degradation of lignin and cellulose at root collar and structural roots producing pale fibrous residue. Structural implication: Progressive reduction in anchorage stability with increased risk of root plate rotation under dynamic wind loading. Failure mode: Windthrow predominant. Taxonomy: Current accepted name Pseudoinonotus dryadeus - previously classified as Inonotus dryadeus, which may appear in older reference material. Dryadeus refers to dryads (oak tree spirits in Greek mythology).	AMBER DROPLETS on bracket at OAK ROOT COLLAR = Pseudoinonotus dryadeus. Amber exudate is unique among common species - no other produces it. If older bracket with no active droplets, check for dried amber staining. Use Pseudoinonotus dryadeus in exam answers - current accepted name. Remember: Pseudoinonotus (Pseudo-in-on-otus), dryadeus (dryad = oak spirit). Amber weeping = only one answer.	pseudoinonotus_amber_droplets
29	YES	Rigidoporus ulmarius	Large Pored Polypore	Root plate reveals white rot in structural roots - soft fibrous pale residue when probed, anchorage integrity reduced	Large pale cream to buff perennial brackets at base - hard woody texture, large angular pores visible on underside (visibly larger than Ganoderma pore openings), pale buff-cream upper surface, no brown spore deposits	Brackets extend onto lower stem, pale cream colour and large angular pore surface consistent	No visible symptoms	No visible symptoms	Progressive crown thinning and reduced vigour as root integrity declines - upper crown may appear relatively healthy while root system is significantly compromised	Pale cream to buff colour combined with large angular pore openings on the underside is characteristic and separates Rigidoporus from all Ganoderma species reliably. No brown spore deposits (present in all common Ganoderma). Hard perennial bracket. Predominantly elm historically, now more commonly beech, oak and other broadleaves. White rot of roots with maintained crown condition.	GANODERMA AUSTRALE: Brown hoof-shaped not pale cream, smaller circular pore openings, heavy brown spore deposits. GANODERMA APPLANATUM: Grey-brown flat shelf not pale cream, smaller pores, brown spore deposits. PERENNIPORIA FRAXINEA: Pale buff but predominantly Fraxinus host, smaller brackets. DISTINGUISHING RIGIDOPORUS: Pale cream to buff colour (notably paler than all Ganoderma species), large angular pore openings visible to naked eye (largest common pore openings), no spore deposits, hard perennial, elm and beech association, white rot of roots.	Host association: Historically Ulmus spp. - now predominantly Fagus sylvatica, Quercus spp. and other broadleaves following widespread elm loss. Primary infection court: Structural roots and root collar. Decay type: White rot - simultaneous degradation of lignin and cellulose producing pale fibrous residue with progressive reduction in root structural integrity. Pore openings: Large angular openings visible to the naked eye - the largest pore openings among common bracket fungi and a reliable separation from Ganoderma species. Structural implication: Progressive reduction in anchorage stability with increased susceptibility to root plate rotation under dynamic loading. Failure mode: Windthrow predominant. Spore deposits: Absent - no brown deposits on ground or lower stem (present in all common Ganoderma, useful negative indicator). Ulmarius = of the elm.	PALE CREAM bracket with LARGE ANGULAR PORES at broadleaf base = Rigidoporus ulmarius. Check pore size - visibly larger than any Ganoderma. No brown spore deposits is a reliable negative separator from all Ganoderma. Remember: Rigidoporus (Rigid-o-porus - rigid, describing hard bracket), ulmarius (ulm = elm). Pale colour plus large pores = Rigidoporus.	rigidoporus_large_pores
